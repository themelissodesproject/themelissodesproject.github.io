                    <p style="line-height: 1.5;">The genus <i><b>Melissodes</b></i> Latreille is a common group of New World long-horned 
                        bees in the tribe Eucerini (Apinae). The antenna of the males often appear to be quite long in comparison to their body lengths, giving them the 
                        name "long-horned bees". However, there are a few exceptions of bee species in the subgenus <i>Melissodes</i> that have varying antenna lengths.
                        Characteristcs of the two sexes commonly
                        differ in appearance, especially in antenna length and scopal hair density (LaBerge, 1956).
                        <i>Melissodes</i> is the second largest genus in the Eucerini tribe with 129 described bees and 5 current
                        subgenera. The majority of the bees live in the United States and Mexico, except for all species of <i>M. (Ecplectica)</i>, which are native
                        to South America (Wright, 2016). <i>Melissodes</i> bees are shown to have some importance in agricultural pollination, pollinating crops such as
                         cotton (LaBerge, 1956), alfalfa (LaBerge, 1956), muskmelons (Winfree, et al., 2007), watermelon (Campbell et al., 2018; Winfree, et al., 2007), conola (O'Brien & Arathi, 2018),
                         and coffee (Ngo et al., 2013).
                        Given the genus has so many species and is prevalent, it is reasonable to assume that they play an important role pollinating many other plants in nature as well.
                    </p style="line-height: 1.5;">
                    <h1 id="description">Description and identification</h1>
                    <hr class="small-bar">
                    <p style="line-height: 1.5;"><i>Melissodes</i> are medium-sized, setaceous bees with males often having long antennae where the first flagellar segment is short 
                        in comparison to the rest of the antennal segments (Laberge, 1956). Both sexes differ from <i>Svastra</i> in lacking spatuloplumose
                         hairs on the basal pubescent band of the second tergum (T2). 
                        Males and females also subtly differ from other Eucerini genera in tegular shape, with the exception of <i>Martinapis</i>. To see the difference, 
                        removal of setae is often necessary. Male <i>Melissodes</i> differ from those in <i>Svastra</i> as a result of the presence of a denticle
                        on either side of the pygidial
                        plate located beneath the strong lateral arm of the gradulus
                        of the 7th dorsal segment (Mitchener, 2007). Common characteristics in the majority of 
                        <i>Melissodes</i> species are as follows: short or absent malar margins of both sexes, the propodeum of both sexes has a distinct dorsal face that never slopes 
                        downward, and the scopal hairs of females have at least one or two branches on either side, excluding one species in <i>Apomelissodes</i> (Laberge, 1956).</p>
                        
                        <h1 class="sub-heading" style="font-size: 20px;"><b>Sexual dimorphism</b></h1>
                        <p style="line-height: 1.5;">
                            <i>Melissodes</i> species provide a clear example of sexual dimorphism. 
                            The males have antennae that often surpass their body length, whereas females 
                            have substantially shorter antennae. For most bee species, males have 13 
                            antennal segments and females have 12 (Mitchener, 2007), this includes <i>Melissodes</i> as shown in Figure 1 (Hogland, 2025 <i>unpublished data</i>). Given research on other 
                            bees within the same family, the additional segment on <i>Melissodes</i> males is most likely an evolutionary 
                            adaptation that allows space for more chemosensory structures, aiding them in locating mates 
                            (Ren et al., 2023; Streinzer et al., 2013). Female <i>Melissodes</i> have long and dense multi-branched 
                            scopal hairs on both hind tibia, which are absent in males (Fig. 2). This is an example of sex-specific 
                            morphological adaptation based on the differing roles of the sexes. Females forage to provision 
                            their nests with pollen allowing for larval development, while males only forage to fuel 
                            themselves and find mates (Larson et al., 2021). This reflects both sexes' morphological traits. 
                            Males wouldn’t have co-evolved with plants and needed thick scopal hairs for pollination, and 
                            females wouldn’t need long antennae to find mates.

                    <p style="line-height: 1.5;">The genus <i>Melissodes</i> was proposed in 1829 by the French Zoologist and entomologist 
                        Latreille to be included in the American Eucernie bees. This was because <i>Melissodes</i> have four segments in their maxillary 
                        palpi and three submarginal cells (Fig. 3). However, Latreille did not include any species in the genus, and was therefore 
                        not valid (Laberge, 1956). In 1841, Romand described the first species in this genus as M. fonscolombei; the female
                        was located in Chile, and the male was located in the West Indies. This was subsequently overturned and updated by the 
                        Secretary of the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature, and M. fonscolombei was deemed to be a nomen 
                        dubium. The first valid entry into the <i>Melissodes</i> genus was <i>Melissodes</i> leprieuri in 1849 by a French entomologist 
                        named Charles Émile Blanchard, thus creating validity for the genus (Laberge, 1956).</p><br>

                        <p style="line-height: 1.5;">
                            In 1956, Laberge showed the relationships among 10 subgenera, split into two groups with a diagram as 
                            shown in Figure 4 (Laberge, 1956; Wright et al., 2020). He hypothesized that <i>Melissodes s.s.</i> and <i>M. 
                            (Eumelissodes)</i> Laberge were derived from <i>M. (Ecplectica)</i> Holmberge, the only South American subgenus of 
                            group two. Laberge also postulated that <i>M. (Apomelissodes)</i> Laberge, <i></i>M. (Tachymelissodes)</i> Laberge, <i>M. 
                            (Heliomelissodes)</i> Laberge and <i>M. (Psilomelissodes)</i> Laberge were subsequently derived from <i>M. (Eumelissodes)</i> 
                            Laberge. In part three (1961), Laberge omitted the entirety of group one from <i>Melissodes</i>, opting for <i>M. 
                            (Epimelissodes)</i> Laberge to become its own genus, with <i>M. (Brachymelissodes)</i> Laberge and <i>M. (Idiomelissodes)</i> 
                            Laberge to be its subgenera. He then added the subgenus <i>M. (Callimelissodes)</i> and hypothesized new 
                            phylogenetic relationships among the subgenera based on 19 morphological traits that were characterized 
                            based on “primitiveness” vs. “specialization” (Laberge, 1956; Wright et al., 2020). His research reflected 
                            that <i>Melissodes s.s.</i> was specialized in more characteristics, and was at least as primitive as <i>M. (Eumelissodes)</i>  
                            Laberge. However, <i>Melissodes s.s.</i> was shown to have a certain specialization in the male terminalia which would 
                            be more reasonably derived from that of <i>M. (Ecplectica)</i> Holmberge than that of <i>Melissodes s.s.</i> The same 
                            characteristic in <i>M. (Eumelissodes)</i> Laberge would also be more reasonably derived from M. (Ecplectica) Holmberge 
                            than <i>Melissodes s.s.</i> (Laberge, 1961). In addition, <i>M. (Ecplectica)</i> Holmberge and <i>Melissodes s.s.</i> share a 
                            defining specialized characteristic of the propodeum of female being shorter or no longer than metanotum medially, 
                            which the others lack. The rest of the subgenera share the specialized characteristic of all the lateral parts 
                            of gradulus being absent or cariniform which in turn lacks in the previous two. This goes to show that there 
                            is a high likelihood for each of the subgenera to have derived from an Ecplectica-like ancestor (Laberge, 1961).

                            In 2023, a taxonomic revision of the taxa in the Eucerini tribe was proposed, including <i>Melissodes</i> and its 
                            subgenera (Freitas et al., 2023). This study presented the new subtribe Melissodina where <i>Melissodes</i> would 
                            reside. Another substantial overhaul included in this paper was the re-organization of the previously stated 
                            subgenera in the genus <i>Melissodes</i>. The re-classification goes as follows: <i>M. (Heliomelissodes)</i> Laberge was 
                            absorbed into <i>M. (Eumelissodes)</i> Laberge, and <i>M. (Psilomelissodes)</i> Laberge plus <i>M. (Tachymelissodes)</i> 
                            Laberge were absorbed into <i>M. (Apomelissodes)</i> Laberge. However, <i>M. (Apomelissodes)</i> Laberge was also 
                            redefined to include not only its original species and <i>M. (Psilomelissodes)</i> plus <i>M. (Tachymelissodes)</i> 
                            Laberge, but also <i>M. paucipunct</i>, which was previously included in <i>M. (Eumelissodes)</i> Laberge (Freitas et 
                            al., 2023). These updates were validated by the Secretary of the International Commission on Zoological 
                            Nomenclature.

                            the New World. The type subgenus <i>Melissodes s.s.</i> has 24 species and was found to be a Nearctic and 
                            Neotropical subgenus (Freitas et al., 2023). This subgenus ranges mostly from North America to South America, 
                            including Mexico and Central America, with only 5 representatives that reach further north or east. 
                            Six species of <i>Melissodes s.s.</i> have been documented in the Antillean Islands, of which one also occurs in 
                            the mainland of South America that crosses over into the northern parts of Brazil. The other South American 
                            subgenus, <i>M. (Ecplectica)</i> Holmberge, has a total of ten described species, with only five in South America. 
                            Three species of <i>M. (Ecplectica)</i> Holmberge, have been documented in the Antillean Islands, and one species 
                            ranges from Panama to northern Mexico. The tenth species has no current locality records. <i>M. (Apomelissodes)</i>
                             Laberge includes 10 species, all are Nearctic (Freitas et al., 2023). Four of its species 
                            have been documented in the southwestern parts of North America, and one of its species has been seen 
                            more widespread throughout parts of the western United States, ranging upwards toward Washington. Five 
                            species of <i>M. (Apomelissodes)</i> Laberge appear in the eastern United States, with two documented as far west as Texas 
                            (Wright et al., 2020). <i>M. (Callimelissodes)</i> Laberge has a total of 14 species, with most living 
                            in the western parts of the United States. Four species of <i>M. (Callimelissodes)</i> Laberge reside 
                            east of the Mississippi, with two of these dipping down into Northern Mexico. The other ten species are 
                            widespread throughout the western United States, with seven of them being in close proximity to California. 
                            Finally, the largest subgenus <i>M. (Eumelissodes)</i> Laberge, has 72 described species and is both a Nearctic 
                            and Neotropical subgenus (Freitas et al., 2023). <i>M. (Eumelissodes)</i> Laberge species range from British 
                            Columbia to Panama. The densest accumulation of <i>M. (Eumelissodes)</i> Laberge 
                            is in the western United States and Mexico. It’s estimated that one third of the species occurs further 
                            east, and about one fifth ranges north toward Canada. Two species have occurred as far south as Central 
                            America, and one has been documented in Cuba (Wright et al., 2020).

                    <p style="line-height: 1.5;">The genus <i><b>Melissodes</b></i> Latreille is a common group of New World long-horned 
                        bees in the tribe Eucerini (Apinae). The antenna of the males often appear to be quite long in comparison to their body lengths, giving them the 
                        name "long-horned bees". However, there are a few exceptions of bee species in the subgenus <i>Melissodes</i> that have varying antenna lengths.
                        Characteristcs of the two sexes commonly
                        differ in appearance, especially in antenna length and scopal hair density (LaBerge, 1956).
                        <i>Melissodes</i> is the second largest genus in the Eucerini tribe with 129 described bees and 5 current
                        subgenera. The majority of the bees live in the United States and Mexico, except for all species of <i>M. (Ecplectica)</i>, which are native
                        to South America (Wright, 2016). <i>Melissodes</i> bees are shown to have some importance in agricultural pollination, pollinating crops such as
                         cotton (LaBerge, 1956), alfalfa (LaBerge, 1956), muskmelons (Winfree, et al., 2007), watermelon (Campbell et al., 2018; Winfree, et al., 2007), conola (O'Brien & Arathi, 2018),
                         and coffee (Ngo et al., 2013).
                        Given the genus has so many species and is prevalent, it is reasonable to assume that they play an important role pollinating many other plants in nature as well.
                    </p style="line-height: 1.5;">
                    <h1 id="description">Description and identification</h1>
                    <hr class="small-bar">
                    <p style="line-height: 1.5;"><i>Melissodes</i> are medium-sized, setaceous bees with males often having long antennae where the first flagellar segment is short 
                        in comparison to the rest of the antennal segments (Laberge, 1956). Both sexes differ from <i>Svastra</i> in lacking spatuloplumose
                         hairs on the basal pubescent band of the second tergum (T2). 
                        Males and females also subtly differ from other Eucerini genera in tegular shape, with the exception of <i>Martinapis</i>. To see the difference, 
                        removal of setae is often necessary. Male <i>Melissodes</i> differ from those in <i>Svastra</i> as a result of the presence of a denticle
                        on either side of the pygidial
                        plate located beneath the strong lateral arm of the gradulus
                        of the 7th dorsal segment (Mitchener, 2007). Common characteristics in the majority of 
                        <i>Melissodes</i> species are as follows: short or absent malar margins of both sexes, the propodeum of both sexes has a distinct dorsal face that never slopes 
                        downward, and the scopal hairs of females have at least one or two branches on either side, excluding one species in <i>Apomelissodes</i> (Laberge, 1956).</p>
                        
                        <h1 class="sub-heading" style="font-size: 20px;"><b>Sexual dimorphism</b></h1>
                        <p style="line-height: 1.5;">
                            <i>Melissodes</i> species provide a clear example of sexual dimorphism. 
                            The males have antennae that often surpass their body length, whereas females 
                            have substantially shorter antennae. For most bee species, males have 13 
                            antennal segments and females have 12 (Mitchener, 2007), this includes <i>Melissodes</i> as shown in Figure 1 (Hogland, 2025 <i>unpublished data</i>). Given research on other 
                            bees within the same family, the additional segment on <i>Melissodes</i> males is most likely an evolutionary 
                            adaptation that allows space for more chemosensory structures, aiding them in locating mates 
                            (Ren et al., 2023; Streinzer et al., 2013). Female <i>Melissodes</i> have long and dense multi-branched 
                            scopal hairs on both hind tibia, which are absent in males (Fig. 2). This is an example of sex-specific 
                            morphological adaptation based on the differing roles of the sexes. Females forage to provision 
                            their nests with pollen allowing for larval development, while males only forage to fuel 
                            themselves and find mates (Larson et al., 2021). This reflects both sexes' morphological traits. 
                            Males wouldn’t have co-evolved with plants and needed thick scopal hairs for pollination, and 
                            females wouldn’t need long antennae to find mates.

                    <p style="line-height: 1.5;">The genus <i>Melissodes</i> was proposed in 1829 by the French Zoologist and entomologist 
                        Latreille to be included in the American Eucernie bees. This was because <i>Melissodes</i> have four segments in their maxillary 
                        palpi and three submarginal cells (Fig. 3). However, Latreille did not include any species in the genus, and was therefore 
                        not valid (Laberge, 1956). In 1841, Romand described the first species in this genus as M. fonscolombei; the female
                        was located in Chile, and the male was located in the West Indies. This was subsequently overturned and updated by the 
                        Secretary of the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature, and M. fonscolombei was deemed to be a nomen 
                        dubium. The first valid entry into the <i>Melissodes</i> genus was <i>Melissodes</i> leprieuri in 1849 by a French entomologist

                            In 1956, Laberge showed the relationships among 10 subgenera, split into two groups with a diagram as 
                            shown in Figure 4 (Laberge, 1956; Wright et al., 2020). He hypothesized that <i>Melissodes s.s.</i> and <i>M. 
                            (Eumelissodes)</i> Laberge were derived from <i>M. (Ecplectica)</i> Holmberge, the only South American subgenus of 
                            group two. Laberge also postulated that <i>M. (Apomelissodes)</i> Laberge, <i></i>M. (Tachymelissodes)</i> Laberge, <i>M. 
                            (Heliomelissodes)</i> Laberge and <i>M. (Psilomelissodes)</i> Laberge were subsequently derived from <i>M. (Eumelissodes)</i> 
                            Laberge. In part three (1961), Laberge omitted the entirety of group one from <i>Melissodes</i>, opting for <i>M. 
                            (Epimelissodes)</i> Laberge to become its own genus, with <i>M. (Brachymelissodes)</i> Laberge and <i>M. (Idiomelissodes)</i> 
                            Laberge to be its subgenera. He then added the subgenus <i>M. (Callimelissodes)</i> and hypothesized new 
                            phylogenetic relationships among the subgenera based on 19 morphological traits that were characterized 
                            based on “primitiveness” vs. “specialization” (Laberge, 1956; Wright et al., 2020). His research reflected 
                            that <i>Melissodes s.s.</i> was specialized in more characteristics, and was at least as primitive as <i>M. (Eumelissodes)</i>  
                            Laberge. However, <i>Melissodes s.s.</i> was shown to have a certain specialization in the male terminalia which would 
                            be more reasonably derived from that of <i>M. (Ecplectica)</i> Holmberge than that of <i>Melissodes s.s.</i> The same 
                            characteristic in <i>M. (Eumelissodes)</i> Laberge would also be more reasonably derived from M. (Ecplectica) Holmberge 
                            than <i>Melissodes s.s.</i> (Laberge, 1961). In addition, <i>M. (Ecplectica)</i> Holmberge and <i>Melissodes s.s.</i> share a 
                            defining specialized characteristic of the propodeum of female being shorter or no longer than metanotum medially, 
                            which the others lack. The rest of the subgenera share the specialized characteristic of all the lateral parts 
                            of gradulus being absent or cariniform which in turn lacks in the previous two. This goes to show that there 
                            is a high likelihood for each of the subgenera to have derived from an Ecplectica-like ancestor (Laberge, 1961).

                            In 2023, a taxonomic revision of the taxa in the Eucerini tribe was proposed, including <i>Melissodes</i> and its 
                            subgenera (Freitas et al., 2023). This study presented the new subtribe Melissodina where <i>Melissodes</i> would 
                            reside. Another substantial overhaul included in this paper was the re-organization of the previously stated 
                            subgenera in the genus <i>Melissodes</i>. The re-classification goes as follows: <i>M. (Heliomelissodes)</i> Laberge was 
                            absorbed into <i>M. (Eumelissodes)</i> Laberge, and <i>M. (Psilomelissodes)</i> Laberge plus <i>M. (Tachymelissodes)</i> 
                            Laberge were absorbed into <i>M. (Apomelissodes)</i> Laberge. However, <i>M. (Apomelissodes)</i> Laberge was also 
                            redefined to include not only its original species and <i>M. (Psilomelissodes)</i> plus <i>M. (Tachymelissodes)</i> 
                            Laberge, but also <i>M. paucipunct</i>, which was previously included in <i>M. (Eumelissodes)</i> Laberge (Freitas et 
                            al., 2023). These updates were validated by the Secretary of the International Commission on Zoological 
                            Nomenclature.

                            <i>Melissodes</i> as a genus is currently a strictly New World genus and each subgenera ranges vastly in 
                            the New World. The type subgenus <i>Melissodes s.s.</i> has 24 species and was found to be a Nearctic and 
                            Neotropical subgenus (Freitas et al., 2023). This subgenus ranges mostly from North America to South America, 
                            including Mexico and Central America, with only 5 representatives that reach further north or east. 
                            Six species of <i>Melissodes s.s.</i> have been documented in the Antillean Islands, of which one also occurs in 
                            the mainland of South America that crosses over into the northern parts of Brazil. The other South American 
                            subgenus, <i>M. (Ecplectica)</i> Holmberge, has a total of ten described species, with only five in South America. 
                            Three species of <i>M. (Ecplectica)</i> Holmberge, have been documented in the Antillean Islands, and one species 
                            ranges from Panama to northern Mexico. The tenth species has no current locality records. <i>M. (Apomelissodes)</i>
                             Laberge includes 10 species, all are Nearctic (Freitas et al., 2023). Four of its species 
                            have been documented in the southwestern parts of North America, and one of its species has been seen 
                            more widespread throughout parts of the western United States, ranging upwards toward Washington. Five 
                            species of <i>M. (Apomelissodes)</i> Laberge appear in the eastern United States, with two documented as far west as Texas 
                            (Wright et al., 2020). <i>M. (Callimelissodes)</i> Laberge has a total of 14 species, with most living 
                            in the western parts of the United States. Four species of <i>M. (Callimelissodes)</i> Laberge reside 
                            east of the Mississippi, with two of these dipping down into Northern Mexico. The other ten species are 
                            widespread throughout the western United States, with seven of them being in close proximity to California. 
                            Finally, the largest subgenus <i>M. (Eumelissodes)</i> Laberge, has 72 described species and is both a Nearctic 
                            and Neotropical subgenus (Freitas et al., 2023). <i>M. (Eumelissodes)</i> Laberge species range from British 
                            Columbia to Panama. The densest accumulation of <i>M. (Eumelissodes)</i> Laberge 
                            is in the western United States and Mexico. It’s estimated that one third of the species occurs further 
                            east, and about one fifth ranges north toward Canada. Two species have occurred as far south as Central 
                            America, and one has been documented in Cuba (Wright et al., 2020).
