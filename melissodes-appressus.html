                    <p style="line-height: 1.5;">Melissodes appressus Laberge is a somewhat rare and geographically limited species of Nearctic bee 
                      (Laberge, 1961). Like all Melissodes, male M. appressus have long antennae, and the females have short antennae in comparison 
                      (see "Genus" page for more information). This species resides in the subgenus M. (Eumelissodes) Laberge. Both sexes of M. 
                      appressus are somewhat distinct from other M. (Eumelissodes) Laberge, but bears a resemblance to M. subagilis. Females can 
                      be distinguished by the distal white to pale ochraceous band of the second tergum at minimum reaching the apical margin laterally 
                      and usually reaches the apex across the entire tergum, consisting of short broad hairs (at maximum each hair twice as long as 
                      wide; treated more thoroughly in “Description and Identification”), the blunt, short, decumbent mesoscutal hairs, 
                      shiny galea, and the inner surfaces of the hind bastitarsi which bare brownish red hairs (Laberge, 1961). Males can be distinguished 
                      from that of other M. (Eumelissodes) Laberge by their shiny galea (except at tips), yellow clypeus except for dark tentorial 
                      depressions and a testaceous apical margin, and entirely black labrum (see “Description and Identification” for more information 
                      on both sexes) (Laberge, 1961). M. apressus is an oligolege of the family Asteracea (as are almost all Melissodes), and seems to 
                      prefer three genera specifically, Isocoma, Guterrezia, and Heterotheca (Laberge, 1961). Although not a generalist in the truest 
                      sense, M. appressus has been collected on 10 other genera of Asteracea, and three other families. However, the three other families 
                      on which it was collected seem to have been visited strictly by males, which just collect nectar, not pollen. So it’s safe to assume 
                      that M. appressus may be polylectic on Asteracea.</p>

                      Based on Laberge's (1961) description, Melissodes appressus are medium sized setacouse bees (somewhat smaller bees within the genus). 
                      Females range from 10 to 12 millimeters in length and 3 to 4 millimeters in width (width measured at the widest portion of the 
                      metasoma). Males are a bit smaller, being about 8 to 11 millimeters in length and 2.5 to 3.0 millimeters in width (width measured 
                      at the widest portion of the metasoma). The female's first flagellar segment is on average 1.98 times the size of the second flagellar 
                      segment (standard deviation 0.017). The males are the opposite where the second flagellar segment is on average 5.86 times the size of 
                      the first flagellar segment (standard deviation 0.145). Female wing length is 2.67 millimeters on average (standard deviation 0.153 
                      millimeters), and male wing length is 2.56 millimeters on average (standard deviation 0.144 millimeters). Females have an average of 
                      12.45 hamuli (standard deviation 0.153; ranging between 12 and 13), while males have an average of 11.40 (standard deviation 0.152; 
                      ranging between 11 and 12).
                    </p>

                    <p style="line-height: 1.5;">
                     According to Laberge (1961), the description of female M. appressus is as follows: the integument is black, differing at the 
                     eyes, which are often blue, but sometimes they’re gray or greenish blue; the mandibles, which are usually rufescent the wing 
                     membranes, which are colorless hyaline; the wing veins, which are usually dark reddish brown; the underside of flagellar 
                     segments 3-10, and usually the second in the apical one-third, which are red to yellow (dark brown on top); the tegulae, 
                     which are piceous; the tarsi, and sometimes the rest of the legs, which are rufescent; the tibial spurs, which are white to 
                     yellow; and the apices of the terga (likely referring only the first tergum, but possibly all), which is/are faintly rufescent, 
                     less than in M. subagilis; The clypeus is shiny, flat without a large bulge or concavity, and has a weak apicomedian carina. 
                     The punctures of the clypeus are round, large, coarse, and mostly separated by half a puncture diameter or less. The oculoclypeal 
                     distance is less than or equal to half of the first flagellar segment’s minimum width. The supraclypeal area is entirely shiny 
                     and unshagreened, or if shagreened, then very finely. The length of the third flagellar segment is approximately equal to the 
                     maximum width (sometimes more, sometimes less). The galeae are dorsally shiny with no shagreening, excluding the apical one-third, 
                     and sometimes less. The lateral areas of the vertex are shiny and have punctures that are mostly separated by two to three puncture 
                     diameters. The four maxillary palpal segments decrease in length from basal to apical in a ratio of about 2.7:2.0:1.7:1.0. The 
                     mesoscutum is shiny and has deep, large, round punctures that are separated by one-half to one puncture diameter on the periphery. 
                     Posteromedially, these punctures are large and separated by one to two puncture diameters, and usually there is a small impunctate 
                     posteromedial area. The scutellum is similar to that of the mesoscutum, but the punctures tend to be denser. The mesepisterna are 
                     shiny and have deep, large punctures that are separated by one-half or less of a puncture diameter.

                    </p>
                    <p style="line-height: 1.5;">
                    The first tergum is shiny and the basal three-fifths has shallow, round punctures that are separated by one-half to one puncture 
                    in diameter. The apical area of the first tergum is impunctate with no anterolaterally indistinct rounded projections on each side 
                    of the tergum. The basal area of the second tergum is shiny, sometimes finely reticularly shagreened, with punctures that are mostly 
                    separated by one puncture diameter. The interband zone of the second tergum has regular, sparse, punctures that are slightly larger 
                    than that of the basal area and mostly separated by more than, or equal to, one puncture diameter. The apical area of the second 
                    tergum usually isn’t present, but when visible, it’s mostly impunctate except for a few small punctures beneath the distal band’s 
                    pubescence. Terga three and four are similar to that of tergum two, but the apical area is usually absent (likely obscured by pubescent 
                    band), and the interband zones have more crowded punctures. The pygidial plate is longer than it is wide basally, “V” shaped, and rounded at 
                    the apex.
                    </p>

                    <p style="line-height: 1.5;">
                     Setal description is as follows: the head hairs are white to pale ochraceous, except for the vertex which has abundant brown 
                     hairs. The hairs of the mesoscutum are decumbent on the anterior most one-third and have a blunt-like appearance, similar to that 
                     of cut hair. These hairs are pale ochraceous to yellowish, except for the posteromedial dark patch of brown hairs which is usually 
                     equal to, or more than, twice the size of the dark patch on the scutellum. The mesopleural hairs are white to pale ochraceous. The 
                     first tergum has basal white to pale ochraceous hairs that reach the apical margin laterally, and is glabrous apicomedially. The basal 
                     white tomentum of the second tergum laterally connects with the white to pale ochraceous distal pale band. The distal band of the 
                     second tergum consists of short broad appressed pubescence (at maximum each hair twice as long as wide) that, in the band’s apical 
                     half, tend not to, or just slightly, overlap each other (notably towards the middle). This band reaches the apical margin at minimum 
                     laterally, but usually reaches the apex across most of the tergum. Sometimes along the apex of the distal band, notably towards the 
                     middle, there’s some brown pubescence. The apical area of the second tergum, if present, tends to be somewhat bare. If the apical area 
                     isn’t bare, then it usually has one to two irregular rows of simple, appressed to subappressed, short, brown hairs. The third tergum is 
                     like that of the second, but the tomentum on the basal area is brown, the apical area is often “absent” (likely obscured by pubescent band), 
                     but if present, then it’s no wider than one-third of the third tergum’s width, and the pubescence of the distal band is longer. The fourth 
                     tergum is similar to that of the third, but the apical area is never present. The fifth and sixth terga have dark brown hairs across the terga, 
                     but laterally, there’s white tufts of hair. The sterna have medial yellow hairs, white apical hairs, and white lateral hairs besides the 
                     last sternum, which seems to have entirely yellow hairs. The legs have white to pale ochraceous hairs except for the outer surfaces of 
                     the fore tibiae and middle tibiae, which are brown; the inner surfaces of the hind basitarsi, which are red to dark reddish brown; and the 
                     scopal hairs, which are white.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="sub-heading" style="font-size: 20px;"><b>Male</b></h2>
                    <p style="line-height: 1.5;">
                    According to Laberge (1961), the description of male M. appressus is as follows: the integument is black, differing at the eyes, which are often blue to 
                    greenish blue, and sometimes they can be gray to yellowish gray; the clypeus, which is yellow besides for the darkened tentorial depressions and the 
                    testaceous apical margin; the wing membranes, which are colorless hyaline; the wing veins, which are reddish brown to red; the tegulae, which are 
                    usually piceous, although sometimes somewhat testaceous dorsally; the tarsi, and sometimes the rest of the legs, which are rufescent; the tibial spurs, 
                    which are white to yellow; and the terga, which are colorless hyaline in the apical areas. The clypeus is flat without a large bulge or concavity. 
                    The oculoclypeal distance is less than or equal to half of the first flagellar segment’s minimum width. The first flagellar segment’s minimum length 
                    is usually equivalent to one-seventh to one-eighth the second segment’s maximum length, and on rare occasions it can be as short at one-tenth the 
                    maximum length of the second segment. The minimum length of the first flagellar segment (smaller side of F1) is often more than half the maximum 
                    length (longer side of F1). The length of the penultimate flagellar segment is longer than three times its width. The flagellum reaches or slightly 
                    surpasses the pterostigma when in repose. The maxillary palpal segments decrease in length from basal to apical in a ratio of about 3.0:2.5:2.0:1.0. 
                    The oblique subapical carinae of the sixth sternum is faint. The remainder of the sculptural characteristics are the same as the female described above except 
                    as follows: The mesoscutum tends to be punctate entirely with no posteromedian impunctate area; the first tergum has punctures that almost reach the 
                    apical margin; terga two, three, and four’s interband zone punctures are separated by one to two punctures in diameter (in general, sparser than that 
                     of the female), and the apical areas are often absent (likely obscured by pubescent bands).
                    </p>

                    <p style="line-height: 1.5;">
                     The 7th sternum’s median plate is subtriangular, larger than the lateral plate, and has abundant short hairs ventrally. The lateral plate of the 
                     7th sternum is also subtriangular. The membranous area between the plates is narrow and almost half the size of the lateral plate. The apicomedial 
                     margin located between the median plates has strongly curved carinae on each side. The 8th sternum is broad near the apex, has several to many hairs 
                     on the apical margin, distinctly emarginate apicomedially, and the ventral tubercle is entirely to slightly bidentate. The ventral tubercle does not 
                     reach the apical margin of the 8th sternum. The Gonostylus is slender, tapers apically, has abundant short hairs on the basal half laterally, and 
                     isn’t distinctly capitate. The length of the gonostylus is longer than half the length of the gonocoxite. The spatha is about three times as wide as 
                     it is long. The spicules of the upper inner surface of the gonocoxite are all if not mostly hairlike. The penis valve has a prominent dorsolateral 
                     lamella; the basal end of the lamella ends in an inflected tooth near the spatha.
                    </p>

                    <p style="line-height: 1.5;">
                     Setal description is as follows: the head hairs are entirely white. The hairs of the mesoscutum are decumbent on the apical most one-third and 
                     differ from the female by not having blunt-tipped hairs. These hairs are white and sometimes pale ochraceous. The mesopleural hairs are white. The 
                     first tergum has pale ochraceous hairs that, in the apical most one-fifth to one-fourth, are appressed and form a band that obscures the apical 
                     margin. The basal tomentum of the second tergum is white as well as the distal pale band. This band reaches the apical margin laterally, but sometimes 
                     reaches the apex across the entire tergum. The interband zone of the second tergum has suberect to erect, long, pale hairs. The apical area of the 
                     second tergum, if present, is glabrous, usually half the length of the distal pale band medially (measured from basal to apical area of pale band), 
                     and less than or equal to half the width of the tergum. Terga three, four, and five are similar to that of two, but the distal bands are positioned 
                     apically obscuring the apical area, except for the third tergum which sometimes has a small apical glabrous area. The sixth and seventh terga have 
                     entirely ochraceous to white hairs. All sterna are white laterally and yellow medially. The leg hairs are white excluding the yellow inner surfaces 
                     of the tarsi.

                      M. appressus is a somewhat rare, and geographically limited species of Nearctic bee (Laberge, 1961). In his treatment, Laberge (1961), noted that 
                      this species has only been found in California. However, newer collections (1961-1985) suggest that M. appressus also occurs in Utah, New Mexico, 
                      and Arizona showing that the range of this species is broader than what has been represented in the historical literature (GBIF Secretariat, 2023). 
                      One datapoint from GBIF (Secretariat, 2023) located in Zacatecas, Mexico has been omitted in the map shown below as this seems to be an outlier and 
                      may not properly reflect M. appressus’ range  (Fig. 1). The only phenological activity currently published for M. appressus states that the species 
                      has been documented to be active from August 14 to November 10 although peak activity during collection periods seemed to occur in September to 
                      October (Laberge, 1961). Newer data seems to reflect this statement, except for one specimen collected in May (see Fig. 2) (Bentley & Osborn, 2025)

                     M. appressus was originally described in 1961 by Wallace Laberge under the name “Melissodes appressa”. When first described, M. appressus was assigned to 
                     the subgenus M. (Eumelissodes), which is also where it currently resides (Laberge, 1961). Little taxonomic reclassification has occurred concerning M. 
                     appressus. Currently, the only taxonomic changes arose when the fourth edition of the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) was 
                     released in 1999, and article 30.1.4.4 was added. This article stated if a genus with the suffix -odes (i.e. Melissodes) was not assigned a specific 
                     gender by the author who proposed it, then the genus becomes masculine. When Melissodes was proposed in 1829 by Latreille, he included no statements 
                     deeming the name “Melissodes” to be feminine or masculine, therefore, the genus became masculine. According to ICZN, species and genus names must 
                     make gender agreement. Because the suffix -a (i.e. appressa) is feminine and the genus name is now masculine, the species name also had to be updated 
                     with a masculine suffix; the suffix -us is masculine hence “appressus” instead of “appressa”. There have since been no taxonomic changes in regards 
                     to M. appressus.
