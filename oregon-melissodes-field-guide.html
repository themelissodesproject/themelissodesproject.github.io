                  <h2 class="top-title" style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 22px; font-weight: bold;"><b>Introduction</b></h2>
                    <p style="line-height: 1.5;">Melissodes Latreille is a common genus of wild bees from the tribe Eucerini occurring in the New World 
                      (Laberge, 1956a; Laberge, 1956b; Laberge, 1961; Wright et al., 2020). As of now, a total of 129 species have been described in this 
                      genus making it the second largest in the Eucerini tribe (Wright et al., 2020). 25 of these species have been documented in Oregon 
                      (see table 1) and 8 have known ranges that overlap portions of Oregon (see table 2). Melissodes are known to be important pollinators 
                      in crops such as cotton (LaBerge, 1956), alfalfa (LaBerge, 1956), muskmelons (Winfree, et al., 2007), watermelon (Campbell et al., 
                      2018; Winfree, et al., 2007), canola (O'Brien & Arathi, 2018), and coffee (Ngo et al., 2013), but most chiefly so in sunflowers 
                      (Parker et al., 1981). Parker (1981) documented that a species of Melissodes (M. agilis) is a more proficient pollinator in sunflowers 
                      than that of the western honeybee. Although their importance has been expressed in agricultural settings (Parker, 1981) and likely in 
                      wild ecosystems due to their abundance (Laberge, 1956a), identification of Melissodes beyond genus is often scarce due to the subtle 
                      characters that differentiate between species. The genus was last revised in a three-part series by W. E. Laberge (1956a; 1956b; 1961) 
                      as well as a later correction to the M. (Callimelissodes) subgeneric key (Laberge, 1963), in which detailed species-specific treatments, 
                      generic and subgeneric keys, and distributions were first presented, representing a cornerstone for current-day Melissodes knowledge. 
                      However, the keys presented in these revisions can be, at times, slightly ambiguous and overwhelming due to the sheer number of species 
                      and intraspecific variation. As a genus, Melissodes are widespread and range over the entirety of the New World, but species differ 
                      largely in what areas they occupy (Laberge, 1956a; Laberge, 1956b; Laberge, 1961; Wright et al., 2020). Many species are restricted to 
                      South America and Central America, which, when trying to identify North American species using a key designed to include all 129 species, 
                      drastically inflates the amount of information needed to identify an individual. The same can be said for species whose ranges are 
                      restricted to specific portions of North America that differ from the location in which a specific individual was found. Herein, a key 
                      developed from that of Laberge (1956a; 1956b; 1961; 1963) using the same structure and traits but incorporating subgeneric splits and 
                      only including species who occur, or are likely to occur, in Oregon is presented. Although using a regional key such as this may not 
                      yield new state records for Oregon, apart from those whose ranges overlap this area and are included in the key, it may assist in ease 
                      of identification beyond genus allowing for species-level studies and less chances for drastic misidentification due to individual 
                      variation. Along with this, species descriptions and comparisons, derived from that of Laberge, (1956a; 1956b; 1961) are given to further 
                      aid in identification.

                    <p style="line-height: 1.5;"> 
                        This field guide is designed to aid in identifying Melissodes species in Oregon. This includes comparisons of similar genera such as Eucera and Diadasia, 
                        which have overlapping ranges and similar morphologies, comparisons of similar species within the genus, and regional keys. Ranges have been determined 
                        using historic taxonomic literature in tandem with GBIF occurrence records (see tables 1 & 2). This data was also used to evaluate distributions, phenology, 
                        and host-plant relationships. Each species has a full treatment used to assist in identification, locality, morphology, and more (species treatments are 
                        outlined below).

                    </p>

                    <h3 class="sub-heading" style="font-size: 18px;"><b><i>Species treatments</i></b></h3>
                    <p style="line-height: 1.5;">
                      Each species description consists of what follows:
Morphological descriptions, particularly of key diagnostic features with accompanying photos of the feature; distribution maps plotted in Leaflet using OpenStreetMap (OSM) 
derived from authoritative taxonomic literature (Laberge, 1956a; 1956b; 1961) and recent sampling from GBIF occurrence records to produce an up-to-date range; phenological graphs created using data from 
GBIF occurrence records; flower records and/or preference if lists are too extensive; when applicable, notes concerning taxonomic history and/or distinctive identifiers; two 
"Feild Marks" and "Similar species" sections (one per sex given the sexual diamorphism) unless stated otherwise; a 
similar naming convention to that used by the North American Native Bee Collaborative (2020) will be adapted for this guide, that being at the beginning of each species treatment, 
a group-name is given to species of similar morphologies (if a group-name is absent, then the species does not specifically resemble another and instead, the word “distinct” 
will take the place of group-name). For most species, as there is insufficient data, phenological graphs will consist of two lines, one representing phenology based on Oregon 
captures, and the other based on captures across each species respective range. Each species "Field Markers" section is based on the information given about both sexes from the genus treatment; 
if not familiar with Melissodes as a genus, reading the genus treatment is recomended before subsequent species treatments. Morphological descriptions for each species are derived from that of Laberge (1956a; 1956b; 1961).
Precursing each of the species treatments, the genus will be treated. This will not include a 
group-name as no other genera are described within this guide; similar genera will be listed instead. 

                    </p>

                      As can be determined below, subtle differences are used in delimiting species of Melissodes. To describe these delimiting characters, terms have been 
                      applied to specific anatomical features and structures. Below is a list of Melissodes images with labeled anatomical features, the terms used to describe 
                      these features will be used throughout the guide; definitions for these terms are also in the glossary with parenthesized use cases.

The basitarsi’s inner surfaces have dark brown to black hairs, and the scopal hairs are usually yellowish and plumous … rivalis<br><br>
In profile view, the clypeus protrudes beyond the eye by less than one-half of an eye's width. If the clypeus is protruding by one-half of an eye’s width, then the inner margins of the eyes are not parallel and instead converge toward the mandibles and/or the hind basitarsi’s inner surfaces have bright red to yellow hairs. The scopal hairs are sometimes branched weakly. Go to 2<br><br>

2. (1) The pygidial plate is narrowly U-shaped and the scopal hairs are somewhat weakly branched, usually having one to two branches on either side of each rachis. Go to 8<br><br>
The pygidial plate is often more V-shaped and has a rounded or acute apex. The scopal hairs are stronger and plumose with most consisting of three or more branches on either side of each rachis. Go to 3<br><br>

3. (2) The second, third, and fourth terga have distal pale bands that are apical, approximately the same width across each terga (not narrowing or widening) and the same 
width to one another, and around as narrow, or narrower, than the basal dark pubescence. The hairs of these bands do not arise from noticeable punctures … dagosus<br><br>
The second, third, and fourth terga, or at minimum just the second tergum, do not have distal pale bands that reach the apex across the entire tergum. If the bands reach 
the apex across the entire tergum, then they diffuse across it instead of making a clear apical band or the bands are much wider than that of the basal dark pubescence. 
Or the bands are not approximately the same width across each terga (narrowing and widening) and not the same width to one another. Or both of these combined. Go to 4<br><br>

4. (3) The ultimate flagellar segment is slightly shorter than, or as wide as, its own width; approximately equal to the length of the penultimate segment. Or the bee 
is small, around 8-9 mm. long and has abundant long hooked galeal hairs above, or incredibly short blunt straight sparse galeal hairs and the galeae is densely regularly tessellated. Go to 8<br><br>
The ultimate flagellar segment is longer than the penultimate segment and longer than it is wide. The bee is small to large, but if small, then the galeae are either not tessellated 
or the hairs are abundant straight and long. Never a small bee with abundant hooked galeal hairs. Go to 5<br><br>

5. (4) The first tergum has sparse dorsal punctures that don’t surpass the basal one-third of the tergum medially, apart from a few widely spaced punctures. 
The galeae are shiny. The surfaces of the interband zones of the second and third terga are dull due to dense, fine, reticulo-transverse shagreening. The 
lateral portions of the thorax and propodeum have black hairs. Go to 8<br><br>

The lateral areas of the thorax and propodeum have pale hairs. If the lateral areas of the thorax and propodeum have dark hairs, then the first tergum has 
dense punctures that reach the basal one-half or more, and/or the galeae are dull due to tessellation or shagreening. Sometimes the surfaces of the second 
and third terga’s interband zones are shiny with no shagreening. Go to 6<br><br>

6. (5) The first tergum has very sparse dorsal punctures that do not surpass the basal one-third of the tergum, and often less than this. If this is the case (pale 
lateral mesepisternal hairs and tergal punctations as described), then either the bee is small to medium-sized and has an elongated somewhat U-shaped pygidial plate, 
with its sides approximately parallel to one another, that's around two times as long as it is wide medially. Or, a larger bee that has its hairs on the inner surfaces 
of the hind basitarsi black, and the hairs on the lower areas of the lateral surface of the mesepisterna are black. Go to 8.<br><br>

The first tergum has abundant punctures that usually reach the basal half of the tergum and sometimes surpass it. If the punctures are very sparse and do not surpass the basal 
one-third of the first tergum, then the bee is medium-sized, its pygidial plate is shorter and V-shaped (in length, shorter than two times its width medially), and the hairs on 
the lower areas of the lateral surface of the mesepisterna are not dark. Go to 7.<br><br>

7. (6) The sixth tergum’s postgradular carina is laterally lamelliform and ends 
abruptly in a blunt short denticle. The apical half of the pygidial plate is 
narrow and its sides are often somewhat parallel to one another unless the plate 
has been worn. The tibial plate is short and its edges show through the hair except 
on the lower anterior angle and anteriorly. Go to 8<br><br>

The sixth tergum’s postgradular carina usually isn’t present laterally, or at most, is only 
cariniform not lamelliform and does not end in a denticle. The apical half of the pygidial plate 
is not narrowed and the sides are not parallel to one another; pygidial plate short and wide. The tibial 
plate is larger and the edge is obscured by hairs, minimally on the anterior half of the lower area, 
and sometimes more unless the hairs are worn. Go to 18<br><br>

8. (2, 4, 5, 6, 7) The galeae have abundant long hooked hairs above and the second, third, and fourth terga are largely covered in short, pale, diffused,

                      Melissodes are perhaps one of the most commonly found wild Apid bee genera in Oregon apart from Bombus and Ceratina (Best et al., 2021b; 2022b). In general, the genus is comprised of very setaceous, robust, and medium 
                      sized bees with the largest Oregonian Melissodes (M. glenwoodensis) in length, measuring 11-14 mm. in the female sex and 10-15 mm. in the male sex (Laberge, 1961; for 
                      reference, Apis melifera measures about 13.2 mm. on average; see DeGrandi-Hoffman et al., 2004). Males and females can be readily distinguished from one another by the 
                      increadibly long antennal length of the males and the scopae on the hind legs and robustness of the females. Melissodes are ground-nesting bees (Laberge, 1956a; Laberge, 1956b; Laberge, 1961; 
                      Michener, 2007) that are most active during the fall months, with peak activity occurring in August and July (see, in part, Fig. 12). This genus is widespread across the entirety 
                      of Oregon, but each species differs slightly in range (see species treatments). Overall, Melissodes as a genus are oligolects of Asteracae, and often nest near 
                      large quantities of these flowers (Parker et al., 1981), which seems reasonable as its been reported that some species home ranges are short, likely around 14-16 meters (Foy, 2025).

                      (although there are exceptions; see M. tristis). The wings have 3 submarginal cells and the eyes tend to have a green color, though not always. The first flagellar 
                      segment is usually incredibly short compared to the rest of the flagellum (except in M. dagosus and sometimes M. rivalis) and the genal area is usually somewhat 
                      narrow laterally (though not always).<br> <br>

                      ♀ Very setaceous and robust with large scopae on the hind legs and almost no malar margin. The wings have 3 submarginal cells and the clypeus is often not very 
                      protuberant (except for M. rivalis). The genal area is usually somewhat narrow laterally (not always) and the vertex is somewhat flat. The tegulae are narrowed anteriorly
                      and the metasoma is often shorter and distally rounded (not wasp-like).

                    <p style="line-height: 1.5;">
                      Although they are a distinctive genus, Melissodes can superficially resemble other genera, prime examples of which are 
                      Eucera and Diadasia. Male Melissodes can reliably be distinguished from that of a male Diadasia by their long antennae 
                      and anteriorly narrowed tegulae (Fig. 7), although females can bear more of a resemblance due to their robustness and scopal hair 
                      location. Female Melissodes can be differentiated from that of female Diadasia due to the anteriorly narrowed tegulae 
                      and flatter vertex outlines when looking in facial view (Michener, 2007; Laberge, 1957; see Fig. 8). Distinguishing between Melissodes 
                      and Eucera can be a bit trickier as both genera reside in the same tribe (Eucerini) and therefore males cannot be separated 
                      by antennae length alone and females share similar features. The most common and most relioable way to separate both sexes of Melissodes 
                      from Eucera is with tegular shape, that being Melissodes tegulae are narrowed anteriorly and Eucera tegulae aren’t 
                      (Michener, 2007; Laberge, 1957; see Fig. 9). Males of Eucera often have entirely black 
                      antennae with no ventral red markings (not always the case, somes species have red colorations ventrally), highly distinct flagellar segmentation, and wider scapes in contrast to the often red ventral to 
                      dorsal antennal markings, less distinct flagellar segmentation, and narrower scapes of Melissodes (Fig. 10; male Melissodes microstictus have entirely black 
                      antennae as well, except for a ventral pale macula, but the flagellar segments are less distinct, the genal area is smaller, 
                      and the clypeus is less protuberant than that of a male Eucera). Both sexes of Eucera also tend to have 
                      larger genal area to eye ratios (not always; Fig. 11), and earlier phenological activity than that of Melissodes (Fig. 12).

                      Melissodes agilis, the agile long-horned bee, is known to be one of the most common and widespread North American Melissodes (Laberge, 1961). Unexpectedly, in Oregon, 
                      this species ranks only fifth most common in the genus with a total of 68 publicly documented state records (Fig. 13). Although not a distinctive species in general, especially in the female 
                      sex, the only resemblance M. agilis directly bears is to M. trinodis which occurs in eastern portions of the United States and Canada (Laberge, 1961). Although M. agilis is widespread across Oregon 
                      (see Fig. 18), M. trinodis doesn't seem to occupy this area and for this 
                      reason, M. agilis is labeled as distinct. Females are known to nest in and around large quantities of Asteraceae, particularly Helianthus, with daily activity beginning around 6:30 AM 
                      to 7:45 AM (likely dependent on location and temperature) and height of activity often in earlier parts of the day (Parker et al., 1981). Parker et al. (1981) found at 
                      9:00 AM, there were twice the amount of females foraging than at 11:00 AM, and at 1:00 PM there were about one-third the amount of females foraging than at 11:00 AM. It 
                      seems that most females stay in their nests during the afternoon (Parker, F. D et al., 1981). Although not enough data is yet available for Oregonian M. agilis phynology, they likely follow 
                      a similar pattern to that of rage-wide M. agilis (see Fig. 19).

                    <p style="line-height: 1.5;">
                      ♂ The flagellum is almost entirely red-colored ventrally except for the first segment. F1 is incredibly short in 
                      comparison to the rest of the flagellar segments, with its maximum length less than, or equal to, one-third of the 
                      third segment’s minimum length. The minimum length of the first flagellar segments is about one-sixth to one-fifth 
                      of the second segment’s maximum length. The penultimate flagellar segment is equal to around three times its width. 
                      The mandibles have yellow maculations on their bases and the labrum is almost entirely pale except for its darkened 
                      margin (in couplet 26, this would count as a large mediobasal pale macula and on couplet 15, these maculations do 
                      not count as large and pale as they are yellow and medium sized). The antennae have no longitudinal depressions and the clypeus
                      is yellow. The apical areas of the terga are widely hyaline, 
                      so much so that at a distance, these can look like large pale pubescent bands (they are not). The wing veins are 
                      very light red to yellow colored and the hairs on the head and thorax are minimally pale ochraceous and often pale 
                      rusty-red. The rest of the hairs on the body tend to be very pale and almost gray-colored, although in more vibrant 
                      individuals, they can be a paler ochraceous. Although not a field marker as immobilization of a specimen is needed, 
                      the galeae are dulled above due to fine reticular shagreening.<br> <br>

                      ♀ The overall vestiture is ochraceous to yellow, usually very few dark hairs if any. The impunctate apical area of the first tergum is 
                      longer than one-half of the basal punctate area and the apical area of the third tergum has no dark hairs. The mesoscutum doesn’t have a 
                      dark brown to black patch of posteromedial hairs, or if so, then very few dark hairs are present. The scopal hairs are ochraceous and the 
                      thoracic hairs are often reddish colored. Although not a field marker as immobilization of a specimen is needed, the galeae are dull above 
                      due to fine and dense tessellation. The sternal hairs are medially reddish brown and become paler laterally. The wing veins are often 
                      somewhat light in comparison to other Melissodes being red to reddish brown (can however vary widely so not highly diagnostic). The facial 
                      and genal hairs are yellow to pale ochraceous (can look somewhat bright compared to other Melissodes).

                     Although distinctive in Oregon, M. agilis can bear somewhat of a resemblance to a few other M. (Eumelissodes) within the same region.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p style="line-height: 1.5;">
                      ♂ M. agilis superficially resembles a number of other Oregonian Melissodes males, the first of which, as the name implies, 
                      is M. subagilis. This species quite starkly differs from M. agilis in the mandibles and labrum having no maculations 
                      and the galeae which are rather unshagreened and shiny in the apical half (only delicately shagreened if shagreened at 
                      all; sometimes densely tessellated). Another species M. agilis can somewhat resemble is M. menuachus. This species differs 
                      from M. agilis in the shiny or delicately shagreened galeae above (Fig. 14) and the longer first flagellar segment (Fig. 15 in pat; F1 minimum length 
                      about one-fifth of the second segment’s maximum length; M. agilis’ F1 minimum length about one-sixth to one-seventh of the 
                      second segment’s maximum length). M. agilis can appear similar to M. lupinus as well, differing largely in the subgeneric 
                      characteristics (M. lupinus is in M. Callimelissodes and M. agilis is in M. Eumelissodes), such as M. lupinus having a convex margin of the fourth 
                      sternum and M. agilis having a transverse margin (Fig. 16), but also differing in 
                      F5-F9 having longitudinal depressions on the outer surface in M. lupinus, and none in M. agilis (Fig. 17). This 
                      is not to say that all other Oregonian Melissodes males bear no resemblance to males of M. agilis, this is just a comparison 
                      of species that bear the highest resemblance.

                      ♀ M. agilis can superficially resemble M. robustior due to the shared ochraceous vestiture. Thy can be easily distinguished 
                      from one another by the absence of a dark posteromedial mesoscutal patch of hairs on M. agilis, and a presence of one on M. 
                      robustior. If the mesoscutal hairs are absent due to wear, the two can also reliably be separated by the absence of dark tegular 
                      hairs on M. agilis, and the presence of them on M. robustior. If tegular hairs are also absent, M. robustior’s apical impunctate 
                      area of the first tergum extends basally on both sides creating somewhat indistinct lateral rounded projections while M. agilis 
                      has basal punctures that extend to the apical area at extreme lateral areas.

                    <p style="line-height: 1.5;">
                     M. agilis is a known oligolege of the tribes Astereae and Heliantheae (Robertson, 1926), and according to the flower records 
                     presented by Laberge (1961) and from more recent reports in literature (see Hogland, 2025a for entire records with updated 
                     synonymy), M. agilis seems to have a strong preference toward the genus Helianthus. According to Laberge (1961), of the 2,153 M. 
                     agilis collected with floral accounts, 1,608 were found atop Helianthus. This renders Helianthus to be favored 74.69% of the time 
                     by M. agilis.

                     Melissodes ablusus is very rare (hence the lack of a common name) with only a single collection from Oregon (DeBano et al., 2024). Before this 
                     state record from Wallowa County (Zumwalt, Oregon), it was believed that M. ablusus only occurred in California (Laberge, 1961), and Utah based on 
                     a 2014 capture (Brigham Young University, Arthropod Collection, 2025). Although only collected in the Northeastern area of Oregon, due to its coastal 
                     presence in California (Laberge, 1961), it seems likely that this species ranges across the entire state. Something of note, M. ablusus was originally 
                     described from one female as a race of M. metenuus that resides in California (Cockerell, 1962). This is interesting as M. metenuus is a known 
                     inhabitant of Oregon, and therefore, it is possible that the singular report of M. ablusus in this region (which is quite a large northward range 
                     expansion), may in fact be a misidentification of M. metenuus. However, given the key-breaks between M. ablusus and M. metenuus for both sexes (the 
                     sex of the M. ablusus specimen from (DeBano et al., 2024) was not given) from Laberge (1961), the likely source in which the Oregonian specimen was 
                     identified, misidentification between the two seems unlikely. As can be determined from above, females of M. ablusus are similar to that of M. metenuus, 
                     but also resemble M. plumosus. Males seem to be similar to that of M. clarkiae based on antennal and flagella structure and, as the males of M. clarkiae 
                     are allied with M. metenuus and M. plumosus, it seems as if the males of M. ablusus may be as well. Given the original description presented by Cockerell 
                     (1926) was only based on a singular female and no males, descriptions from that of Laberge (1961) regarding males of M. ablusus are purely based on 
                     morphological characters, and are therefore tentative. With how few collections there are in general, and only a singular collection in Oregon, a map 
                     and phenology chart will be omitted.

                    <p style="line-height: 1.5;">Due to both the sexual dimorphism and the female dimorphism, three separate treatments will be 
                      listed in this section, (1) males, (2) dark females, (3) light females.</p>
                    <p style="line-height: 1.5;">
                      ♂ The flagella (except the first completely dark flagellar segment) are orange-red and distinct longitudinal depressions laterally on F4-F10 (usually on F3 and F11 as well). The penultimate flagellar segment’s length 
                      is two times its width or less and the galeae are densely tessellated. The first flagellar segment’s minimum length is less than one-fifth of the second 
                      segment’s maximum length and the fourth sternum’s posterior apical area is widely convex. Terga 2-5 are opaque brown and occasionally translucent and yellowish 
                      apically and the mandibular bases are cream colored (almost as pale as the labrum). The apical margin of the broad flap on the fourth sternum is not emarginate 
                      medially (this would count as weakly medially emarginate on the second couplet), and sterna 3 and 5 are distinctly convex apically. Somewhat pale in vestiture, 
                      with the sixth and seventh terga having brown hairs (not black like M. communis and M. tepidus).
<br> <br>

                      ♀ (Dark) The darker females have densely tessellated galeae and measure to be around 9-11 mm. in length. The head hairs are entirely black and the 
                      thorax is a dark brown except for sparse pale-ish brown to ochraceous hairs that surround the base of the wing (these sparse pale-ish brown to ochraceous 
                      hairs are also present dorsally on the metanotum and propodeum). The first tergum’s crowded basal punctures usually extend to the basal half medially and, 
                      in the medial one-third, these punctures are mostly separated by one puncture width or less; minimally basally and sometimes more. The scopae are mostly 
                      yellow to white, only brown near the basitibial plate as well as the apical areas of the basitarsi, and the ultimate flagellar segment is noticeably longer 
                      than it is wide. Terga 2-4 have pale pubescent bands, descriptions of which follow: the basal zone of the second tergum has wide oblique fasciae of pale 
                      pubescence present laterally that can sometimes almost meet medially and reach the apical margin laterally, if this is the case, then the fasciae is dark 
                      brown apicolaterally and medially; The third tergum’s distal pale pubescent band is medially brown and separated from the apical margin by dark brown pubescence 
                      and suberect hairs; the fourth tergum’s apical pubescent band is often dark brown, and occasionally pale brown laterally (only laterally, never medially). 
                      Terga five and six have no lateral pale hairs.
<br><br>

                      ♀ (Light) The lighter females have densely tessellated galeae and measure to be around 9-11 mm. in length (similar to that of the darker females). 
                      The head hairs are usually pale apart from the abundant darker vertex hairs. The hairs on the inner surface of the hind bastitarsi and tibiae are 
                      usually pale-colored red to yellow (if the head hairs and hairs on the inner surface of the hind bastitarsi and tibiae are mostly dark, then the 
                      galeae are always dull; if not, check M. metennus). The thoracic hairs tend to be ochraceous to pale ochraceous, apart from the mesoscutum, which 
                      has a large dark brown patch of hair posteromedially that usually reaches forward to the anterior margins of the tegulae, and the scutellum, which 
                      has a large dark brown medial patch of hair. Terga 2-4 have pale pubescent bands, descriptions of which follow: the second tergum’s basal zone has 
                      long pale ochraceous pubescence and the interband zone has short and relatively simple suberect dark brown to dark ochraceous hairs; the distal, 
                      pale pubescent band of the second tergum is wide and arched  (the band is narrowly interrupted medially and reaches or almost reaches the apex of 
                      the tergum laterally); the apical area of the second tergum has short and simple appressed to suberect, brownish ochraceous hairs, apart from the 
                      narrow glabrous margin; the third tergum is similar to that of the second, but the interband zone often has sparse, appressed, pale pubescence, and 
                      the pale distal band is broader, narrowly interrupted medially, and extends to the apical margin laterally; the medial area of the fourth tergum has 
                      a narrow dark pubescent area along the apical margin, and the broad, pale, pubescent band has scattered brown pubescence (the band is located basally 
                      from the narrow dark pubescent area); terga 5 and 6 have dark brown hairs (tergum 5 has small lateral pale tufts). The first tergum’s crowded basal 
                      punctures usually extend to the basal half medially and, in the medial one-third, these punctures are mostly separated by one puncture width or less; 
                      minimally basally and sometimes more.

                    <p style="line-height: 1.5;">
                     As stated above, M. ablusus is similar to that of M. plumosus and M. metenuus in the female sex, and M. clarkiae in the male sex. However, 
                     another species that is very closely related to M. ablusus in both sexes is M. minusculus. Although Laberge (1961) even notes that M. minusculus 
                     may in fact be a color variation of M. ablusus, but later denies this hypothesis based on punctuation and vestiture differences (M. minusculus 
                     seems to be consistent with their light vestiture in contrast to the darkness of M. ablusus). Although M. minusculus currently has no Oregon records, 
                     a recent collection in Idaho (Ikerd, 2019) seems to indicate a northward range expansion, which likely includes portions of Oregon. For this reason, M. 
                     minusculus will be included within the comparisons below. Similar to the field marks above, due to both the sexual dimorphism and the female dimorphism, 
                     three separate similar species comparisons will be listed in this section, (1) males (2) dark females (3) light females.</p>

                     <p style="line-height: 1.5;">♂ Males of M. ablusus are similar to that of M. clarkiae based on the length on the length of the penultimate flagellar 
                      segment (in both species it’s two times its width or less) and the longitudinal depressions on the outer surfaces of F4-F10. However, these two species 
                      differ in the galeal sculpturing and the length of the first flagellar segment. M. ablusus have matte and dull galeae due to coarse, dense, and regular 
                      tessellation, whereas M. clarkiae have somewhat shiny to shiny galeae, but faintly dulled due to delicate reticular shagreening (the galeal surface is 
                      never tessellated). The minimum length of the first flagellar segment in M. ablusus is less than one-fifth of the second segment’s maximum length, whereas 
                      in M. clarkiae, the minimum length of the first flagellar segment is more than one-fifth of the second segment’s maximum length. M. ablusus is also quite 
                      similar to M. minusculus, though somewhat darker in vestiture. The two can be separated by the hairs on terga 6 and 7, where, in M. ablusus, these are 
                      mostly brown, and in M. minusculus, these are white to gold-colored. Although somewhat allied with M. metenuus and M. plumosus, M. ablusus starkly differs 
                      in the length of the penultimate segment. That being, in M. ablusus, the length of the penultimate segment is two times its width or less (as stated above), 
                      whereas in M. metenuus and M. plumosus, this segment is longer than two times its width.</p>

                       <p style="line-height: 1.5;">♀ (Dark) darker females of M. ablusus are similar to that of the M. metenuus females based on the dark vetiture. However, 
                        the two differ in the galeal sculpture and tergal punctuation. That being M. ablusus has matte and dull galeae due to coarse, dense, regular tessellation, 
                        whereas M. metenuus has shiny to moderately shiny galeae with no, or very little, faint shagreening. Also, M. ablusus tends to have denser punctures on the 
                        terga than that of M. metenuus. M. ablusus also bears a resemblance to M. minusculus based on the coarsely, densely, regularly tessellated galeae, but 
                        can be separated by the darker vestiture (especially by the dark hairs on the face below the vertex). Another species allied to M. ablusus is M. plumosus, 
                        although darker individuals of M. ablusus tend not to superficially resemble M. plumosus. Nonetheless, M. ablusus can be identified from that of M. plumosus 
                        much as it is M. metenuus (dull galeae and denser punctures on the terga), but also by the darker vestiture.</p>

                        <p style="line-height: 1.5;">♀ (Light) the lighter females of M. ablusus are much more similar to that of M. plumosus than that of M. metenuus due to the 
                          lighter hairs (mixed with darker hairs) on the facial areas. Similar to the dark females, lighter M. ablusus can be separated from both of these species 
                          by the dull galeae due to coarse, dense, regular tessellation and denser tergal punctures. Also similar to the darker female (due to these characters based 
                          on structure and sculpture instead of hair color), lighter M. ablusus bears a resemblance to M. minusculus based on the coarsely, densely, regularly 
                          tessellated galeae. However, these two are instead separated by the dark and pale hairs mixed on the face below the vertex in M. ablusus, and the entirely 
                          white head hairs (apart from the brown vertex hairs), including the face, in M. minusculus.</p>

<p style="line-height: 1.5;">
                    Melissodes bicoloratus is a somewhat uncommon M. (Eumelissodes) known to inhabit western areas of the United States. Although there are no current Oregon records, this 
                    species has recently been collected in Washington (Ikerd & Engler, 2023), a large northward range-expansion that likely includes parts, and most of, Oregon (Fig. ??). 
                    Females of this species are very similar to that of M. bimatris and quite closely resemble their darker forms, differing at the scopal hair coloration. Females also 
                    resemble M. nigracauda, seemingly to a higher degree than that of the darker M. bimatris, and, based on vestiture alone, can’t be separated from one another. M. nigracauda, 
                    similarly to M. bicoloratus, currently hasn’t been found in Oregon, but has been collected in Washington (Washington State Department of Agriculture, 2025). When including 
                    this point in a map, and outlining a range based on collection locations, portions of Oregon become overlapped (See “Melissodes nigracauda” species treatment). For this 
                    reason, M. nigracauda is included in the foregoing comparisons. Males of M. bicoloratus are similar to that of M. bimatris in vestiture, apart from the apical band not 
                    medially obscuring the apical margin of the first tergum, and integumental color, apart from the lighter wing veins. Males are also somewhat similar to M. agilis and M. 
                    subagilis due to the aforementioned light wing veins, and M. lutulentus due to the vestiture on the first tergum (see “Similar Species” for more info). M. bicoloratus seems to be active between the months of March and 
                    October, with peak activity occurring in July (see Fig. ??).

                    <h3 class="sub-heading" style="font-size: 18px;"><b><i>Field Markers</i></b></h3>
                    <p style="line-height: 1.5;">Due to both the sexual dimorphism and the female dimorphism, three separate treatments will be 
                      listed in this section, (1) males, (2) dark females, (3) light females.</p>
                    <p style="line-height: 1.5;">
                      ♂ The flagellum is almost entirely red-colored ventrally except for the first entirely dark segment and the first tergum’s apical margin is 
                      obscured, but only in extreme lateral areas, not medially. The labrum is entirely black and the wing veins are reddish yellow to yellow and 
                      the clypeus is yellow except for the usually piceous apical margin. None of the flagellar segments have longitudinal lateral depressions, 
                      and F8-F10 or F7-F10 are not crenulated. The overall vestiture coloration is very pale ochraceous to white and the dorsal areas of the scutellum 
                      and mesoscutum do not have dark hairs. The mandibles are completely black without a basal yellow to pale maculation and the first flagellar 
                      segment’s minimum length is about two-thirds of its maximum length, and about one-sixth the maximum length of the second segment. The apical 
                      areas of the terga are colorless hyaline or slightly infumate and translucent but not opaque and the last two terga only have pale hairs (not 
                      black or dark brown).
<br> <br>

                      ♀ The females of M. bicoloratus are quite distinctive compared to almost all other Melissodes due to their dark coloration. The overall vestiture is 
                      almost completely dark except as follows: the dorsum of the thorax, vertex, and upper mesoplural areas, which are ochraceous to near-yellow; the upper 
                      areas of the face, the areas around the antennal fossae, which are usually pale ochraceous. The metasomal hairs are mostly dark, but there are a few 
                      paler hairs on the basal one-half ton three-fifth of the first tergum, and some basal pale hairs on the second tergum as well. The scopae are entirely 
                      dark. The wing veins are red to reddish brown and the galeae are somewhat shiny with no shagreening dorsally excluding some faint delicate shagreening 
                      in less than, or equal to, the apical half. The mesoscutum is shiny and sparsely or not at all shagreened and has deep large punctures that vary in 
                      diameter and are mostly separated by one-half to one puncture diameter. The underside of flagellar segments 3-10 are rufescent and the eyes are often 
                      greenish gray to dark gray. The terga do not have their pubescent bands complete but instead these “bands” more so resemble lateral fasciae, or sometimes 
                      entirely absent. If one of the tergal bands is complete, then it’s the second tergum’s band and the hairs on the lower lateral mesepisternal surfaces are 
                      dark brown.
                    </p>

                    <p style="line-height: 1.5;">
                     ♂ To an extent, males of M. bicoloratus can resemble those of M. agilis, M. subagilis, M. lutulentus and M. bimatris. M. bicoloratus can be separated 
                     from M. agilis based on the shiny galeae, black mandibular bases, and hairs on the first tergum that obscure the apical area laterally. This species can 
                     also be identified from those of M. subagilis in a similar fashion, although, M. subagilis also have black mandibular bases, and therefore this character 
                     cannot be used. Moreover, M. bicoloratus is predominantly extremely pale ochraceous to white in vestiture, whereas M. subagilis is often somewhat yellow 
                     to ochraceous. M. bicoloratus can quite quickly be separated from those of M. bimatris due to the lack of a distinct apical band across the entire apical 
                     margin of the first tergum (in M. bicoloratus, these apical hairs are only present laterally, not medially). Similar to M. bimatris, M. lutulentus can 
                     somewhat superficially resemble M. bicoloratus due to the apical band of the first tergum. M. bicoloratus differs from M. lutulentus by the light mesoscutal 
                     and scutellar hairs (somtimes there are dark mesoscutal and scutellar hairs on M. lutulentus) and the apical hairs on the first tergum which are medially 
                     sparse and/or minutely barbed; only dense and plumose laterally. In M. lutulentus, these apical hairs are appressed, white, dense, plumose, and short, creating 
                     a distinct band that reaches the apex across the entire tergum.</p>

                     <p style="line-height: 1.5;">
                     ♀ The females of M. bicoloratus closely resemble two species, those being M. bimatris and M. nigracauda, but can also somewhat resemble M. pullatellus and M. 
                     rivalis, be it not strongly. Females can be reliably and quickly separated from M. bimatris by the dark scopal hairs. However, females of  M. nigracauda share 
                     the exact same vestiture coloration as M. bicoloratus including the dark scopae, and because of this, they are indistinguishable from one another using setae 
                     alone. Although not necessarily identifiable on the wing from each other as immobilization is required, M. biocoloratus can be distinguished from M. nigracauda 
                     by the unshagreened shiny galeae. Due to its dark vestiture, M. bicoloratus can somewhat resemble other melanistic Oregonian species, those being M. pullatellus 
                     and darker varieties of M. rivalis. Females can be identified from both of these species by the dorsal thoracic areas having ochraceous to near-yellow hairs 
                     (no dark hairs). Furthermore, M. bicoloratus differs from M. rivalis by the dark scopae and convergence of eyes towards the mandibles, and differs from M. 
                     pullatellus by the aforementioned entirely ochraceous to near-yellow dorsal thoracic hairs.</p>

                     Melissodes bimatris, the mothered long-horn bee, is incredibly variable in the female sex. As seen in the group-name statement, M. 
                     bimatris females can take a dark or light form (Fig. 20; males aren’t nearly as variable). This species is somewhat uncommon across 
                     its entire range, and it seems similarly so in Oregon with only 12 publicly documented occurrences placing it 14th most common in the 
                     genus (see Fig. 13). Males of M. bimaris resemble M. semilupinus and, depending on which morph, females can either resemble M. 
                     bicoloratus and M. nigracuada (dark), or M. semilupinus (light). Although not documented across the entirety of Oregon, with the 
                     most westward collection occurring in Klamath county (Fig. ??; McElrath, 2023a), it seems likely, given its coastal presence in 
                     California (Laberge, 1961), that M. bimatris’ range overlaps the entire state. This species seems to be active from May to November, but most chiefly so in September (see Fig. ??).

                      listed in this section, (1) males, (2) dark females, (3) light females.</p>
                    <p style="line-height: 1.5;">
                      ♂ The flagella (except the first completely dark flagellar segment) are usually reddish-orange ventrally and darker dorsally and the mandibles as well as the labrum often 
                      lack maculations (labrum is usually entirely dark, but sometimes there is a small mediobasal pale macula; mandibles 
                      always lack maculations). In general (when unworn) a very setaceous bee compared to others in the genus, likely appearing 
                      this way due to the dense apical pubescent band covering the apical margin on the first tergum. The tergal apical margins 
                      are transparent to hyaline (first tergum's apical margin cannot be seen due to the aforementioned band) and the clypeus is 
                      entirely yellow except for the tentinoral depressions (black) and apical margin (often piceous). The first flagellar 
                      segment’s maximum length is more than one-third of the third segment’s minimum length. The first flagellar segment’s 
                      minimum length is around one-fifth of the second segment’s maximum length, or less. Often quite pale in vestiture, similar 
                      to that of M. agilis, but does range to paler ochraceous colors as well, with darker hairs on the dorsal areas of the head 
                      (vertex) and thorax. The eyes are often green.<br> <br>

                      ♀ (Dark) The vestiture is almost completely dark apart from the pale ochraceous to near-yellow dorsal thoracic hairs 
                      (sometimes these hairs occur the base of T2 and T1) and bright ochraceous to fluvo-ochraceous scopal hairs except for 
                      the inner surfaces of the hind basitarsi which have dark hairs. The eyes are usually blue (not always) and the mesoscutum doesn’t 
                      have a dark brown to black patch of posteromedial hairs, or if so, then very few dark hairs are present. The first tergum’s 
                      apical impunctate area is medially equal to, or less than, one-half of the punctate basal area. The galeae are shiny and the 
                      mesoscutum is shiny without shagreening.<br><br>

                      ♀ (Light) The general vestiture is mostly white to pale ochraceous with darker ochraceous hairs on the dorsal thoracic and head (vertex) areas. 
                      The first tergum’s apical impunctate area is medially equal to, or less than, one-half of the punctate basal area. The apical areas 
                      of the second and third tergum have long, pale, suberect hairs and the mesoscutum doesn’t have a patch of dark brown to black 
                      posteromedial hairs (if patch present, then composed of very few dark hairs). The hairs on the legs (excluding scopae) are mostly 
                      pale ochraceous to white, apart from the outer apical area of the fore tibiae and middle tibiae, the fore tarsi, and inner 
                      surfaces of the hind basitarsi, which are dark reddish brown to brown. The scopal hairs are sometimes pale ochraceous but often 
                      pale yellow and notably long. The galeae are shiny and the mesoscutum is shiny without shagreening. The flagella are usually 
                      entirely black without red ventral markings and the second flagellar segment

                    <p style="line-height: 1.5;">
                     While highly distinctive within the males due to the dense hair band obscuring the apical margin of the first tergum along with 
                     the lack of mandibular maculations (lack of mandibular maculations separating it from that of M. semilupinus), and the dark females 
                     are distinctive due to the fluvo-ochraceous scopae, lighter forms of the females have an incredibly high resemblance to M. semilupinus. 
                     Similar to the field marks above, due to both the sexual dimorphism and the female dimorphism, three separate similar species comparisons

                     ♂ Males of M. bimatris are analogous to that of M. semilupinus (as stated above), mostly so due to the apical band across the second 
                     tergum (Fig. 22). However, the two can be quite reliably and easily separated from one another by the lack of mandibular maculations on M. bimatris 
                     and the presence of them on M. semilupinus (Fig. 23). Due to these distinctive characters, no other Melissodes, except for M. semilupinus, directly 
                     resemble M. bimatris (apart from similar vestiture coloration).</p>

<p style="line-height: 1.5;">
                     ♀ (Dark) The darker females of M. bimatris are quite distinctive and easily recognisable due to their melanistic vestiture in contrast to their light dorsal thoracic hairs. Out of the entire genus, only two other 
                     Melissodes share this same coloration, those being M. bicoloratus and M. nigracauda. Interestingly, neither have currently been 
                     collected in Oregon, but both have been recently collected in Washington (Ikerd & Engler, 2023; Washington State Department of Agriculture, 
                     2025), a range-expansion that includes parts, and most of, Oregon (see respective species treatments for more information). For this reason, 
                     these two species will be included within this comparison. M. bimatris is distinct and easily told apart from both M. bicoloratus and M. 
                     nigracauda by the light scopal hairs in contrast to the dark, almost nearing black, scopal hairs of M. bicoloratus and M. nigracauda (Fig. 24). 
                     M. bimatris also differs from that of M. nigracauda by the shiny galeae in contrast to the shagreened and dulled galeae of M. nigracauda (M. 
                     bicoloratus also have shiny galeae, and therefore, this character cannot be used in comparison between the two).</p>

                     as their current known range doesn't include or overlap Oregon, but comparisons will be made for M. semilupinus. The most notable difference between M. 
                     bimatris and M. semilupinus is the second flagellar segment's length. In M. semilupinus, the length of the second flagellar segment is faintly, but noticeably 
                     longer than its width, whereas in M. bimatris, the length of the second flagellar segment is less than, or equal to, its width.

M. bimatris is a known oligolect of Asteraceae (as are almost all Melissodes) but seems to specifically prefer the genus Chrysothamnus (Laberge, 1961). As 
Laberge (1961) presented, of the 72 M. bimatris collected with floral accounts, 53 were found atop Chrysothamnus. This renders Chrysothamnus to be favored 
73.61% of the time by M. bimatris.

                <p style="line-height: 1.5;">
                     Melissodes clarkiae is a somewhat distinctive bee that seems to be allied with M. metenuus and M. plumosus in both sexes, and M. ablusus as well as M. minisculus (due to the antennal structure) in the male sex. 
                     This species was originally known to inhabit only the coastal areas of Oregon and California (Laberge, 1961). However, a collection in Oregon from 2019 implies 
                     a presence further inland that historically assumed (see Fig. ??; Best et al., 2022a). The females are quite distinct from all other Melissodes within their 
                     subgenus (Callimelissodes) due to the scopal hairs usually consisting of only one or two branches on either side of the rachis and the rachis protruding beyond 
                     the branched area. The males are distinct in F4-F10, and often F3-F11 having longitudinal depressions on the outer surface, the length of the penultimate flagellar 
                     segment being two times its width or less, the shiny to somewhat shiny galeae, and the minimum length of F1 being more than one-fifth of F2’s maximum length. 
                     Although distinctive in the manner, the males are similar to those of M. metenuus and M. plumosus, but aren’t put in this group due to the length of the penultimate 
                     flagellar segment (see more in “Similar Species”). Something of note, due to the simple feebally branched hairs on the scopae, females (unlike many other Melissodes) 
                     likely do not carry Asteraceae pollen and therefore likely do not pollinate such plants (Laberge, 1961). While very few records are available with floral data 
                     attached, the morphological structure of both the scopae of M. clarkiae and the small dry spherical pollen of Asteraceae plants do not suggest a relationship between 
                     the two (the feebly branched scopae likely can’t hold the small pollen grains; Laberge, 1961). As presented by Laberge (1961), M. clarkiae is a probable oligolect of 
                     Onagraceae due to its scopal structure lending way in carrying pollen tethered by viscin threads (such as plants in the genus Oenothera; Cruden & Jensen), or larger 
                     triangularly shaped pollen (such as the plants in the genera Clarkia, hence the common name; Halbritter, 2016).

                      ♂ The flagellum is almost entirely red-colored ventrally except for the first entirely dark segment. The mandibular bases and labrum are yellow, 
                      but the labrum is marginally darkened. The clypeus is lemon-yellow, but very narrowly darkened posteriorly, and flagellar segments 3-10, usually 
                      the base of F11 as well, have shiny, shallow, longitudinal dorsolateral depressions. The length of the penultimate flagellar segment is equal to, 
                      or shorter than, twice its width (usually faintly shorter) and the ultimate segment’s length is more than three times its width. The fourth sternum 
                      has a wide hyaline flap that is medially incredibly shallowly, or not at all, emarginate, and the fifth and third sterna are noticeably apically 
                      convex. The overall vestiture is mostly cinereous, including the vertex of the head and dorsal thoracic areas. Terga 2-4 have pale pubescent bands, 
                      descriptions of which follow: the overall vestiture of the second tergum is pale ochraceous to white with the basal and distal bands taking on the 
                      latter color (distal band medially interrupted); the apical area of the second tergum bears simple, suberect, often pale ochraceous (sometimes brown) 
                      hairs; the third and fourth terga are similar to that of the second, apart from the distal bands being uninterrupted, the basal tomentum being brown, 
                      and the apical hairs being largely brown (minimally medially and sometimes more); the fifth tergum similar to that of the fourth, except the distal 
                      band often reaches the apex across the entire tergum; terga six and seven are entirely covered in golden-brown to golden-yellow hairs. The eyes are 
                      often bluish gray to gray, and on rare occasions, greenish blue. The galeae are often dull due to dense shagreening.<br><br>

                      ♀ Somewhat pale in vestiture with some darker patches of hairs on the vertex, the scutellum, and the posteromedial areas of the mesoscutum (mesoscutal 
                      dark patch reaches, or almost reaches, the anterior margins of the tegulae). The scopal hairs are long and usually consist of only one or two branches on 
                      either side of the rachis and the rachis protrudes beyond the branched area. The underside of F3-F10, and usually the apical area of F2, are yellow to 
                      reddish and the galeae are somewhat shiny above, but dulled due to minute reticular shagreening, often becoming less shagreened in the apical one-third, 
                      and have largely spaced punctures with straight hairs arising from them. The mesoscutum is posteromedially, laterally, and anteriorly shiny and often has 
                      a small impuncate area posteromedially. The pygidial plate is narrowly U-shaped and the wing veins are dark brown. Terga 2-4 have pale pubescent bands, 
                      descriptions of which follow: the distal pale pubescent band of the second tergum is wide, often becomes medially interrupted, arched, and laterally reaches, 
                      or almost reaches, the apes of the tergum; the apical area of the second tergum is narrowly glabrous marginally, but anterior to this margin bears suberect to 
                      appressed, simple, ochraceous to brown hairs (more than that of M. lupinus); the third tergum, is similar to that of the second, apart from the wider 
                      uninterrupted distal band that is noticeably spaced from the apical margin (not reaching the apex), and the interband zone, which bears appressed, sparse, 
                      pale pubescence; the pale ochraceous band on the fourth tergum is wide, positioned apically (no pale simple hairs near the medial area of the apical margin). 
                      The fifth and sixth terga are covered in pale brown hairs apart from the large lateral tufts, which are cinereous., and the sternal hairs are golden brown, 
                      but laterally, these hairs become whitish.

                     M. clarkiae is quite distinctive in both sexes, but most predominantly so in females. In general, the characteristic of simple scopal hairs are quite 
                     distinctive throughout the entire genus, but in Oregon, M. clarkiae is the only species with this trait. Males are distinctive in F4-F10 (usually partially 
                     developed in F3 and F11) having longitudinal depressions, the penultimate flagellar segment’s length being equal to, or shorter than, two times its width, 
                     and the somewhat shiny to shiny galeae that are only faintly dulled due to delicate reticular shagreening (not tessellated). However, due to their allyship, 
                     M. clarkiae can superficially resemble M. metenuus and M. plumosus in both sexes, and M. ablusus as well as M. minusculus (due to the antennal structure) in 
                     the male sex. 

<p style="line-height: 1.5;">
                     ♂ Males can somewhat resemble M. metenuus and M. plumosus, but more strongly so for M. ablusus and M. minusculus due to the distinctive antennal structure they share. M. clarkiae 
                     can be separated from M. metenuus and M. plumosus by the length of the penultimate flagellar segment. That being, in M. clarkiae, the length of the penultimate flagellar segment is 
                     two times its width or less, whereas in M. metenuus and M. plumosus, the length of the penultimate flagellar segment is longer than two times its width. In regards to M. ablusus and 
                     M. minusculus, M. clarkiae can be separated from both by the galeae, which are somewhat shiny to shiny dorsally but faintly dulled due to delicate reticular shagreening (no tessellation), 
                     in contrast to the matte and dull galeae due to coarse, dense, and regular tessellation of M. ablusus and M. minusculus. Also, the minimum length of the first flagellar segment of M. 
                     clarkiae is less than one-fifth of the second segment’s maximum length, whereas for M. ablusus and M. minusculus, F1’s minimum length is more than one-fifth of F2’s maximum length. </p>

                     <p style="line-height: 1.5;">
                     ♀ Females are more strongly allied with M. metenuus and M. plumosus than the males, but not by much. M. clarkiae is separated from all Melissodes in Oregon by the combination of 
                     the U-shaped pygidial plate and the simple scopal hairs. Due to this, no Melissodes directly resemble those of M. clarkiae, and a further comparison is unnecessary.

M. clarkiae seems to be an oligolect of Onagraceae due to the scopal structure and flower records. However, very few flower records are available (7), so a definitive statement on oligolecey and/or preference seems unjustified.
All flower records included in this list are from reports in the literature or datasets. Each flower has a parenthesized 
                    reference listed after it, corresponding to the literary work or dataset in which it was recorded. Currently, M. clarkiae has been found atop Clarkia speciosa subsp. speciosa (Laberge, 1961).

                     Melissodes communis, the common long-horn bee, is quite distinctive due to the paucity of 
                     species in its subgenus (Melissodes s.s.) that occur in Oregon. Males are highly 
                     distinctive due to the black hairs on the last two terga, entirely yellow clypeus 
                     with no dark margin (excluding the tentorial depressions) ( Melissodes s.s. subgeneric 
                     characteristic) and the thin distal band on the second tergum. Females are also 
                     distinctive, though like most species in the genus, less so than the males. Females 
                     are distinctive in the length of the metanotum, the coloration of the hairs on the 
                     inner surfaces of the hind basitarsi, the comparably “impunctuate” apical tergal areas, 
                     and the narrow bands on the second and third terga that do not diffuse across most of the 
                     tergum. M. communis contains two subspecies (M. communis ssp. communis and M. communis 
                     ssp. alopex), only one of which occurs in Oregon (M. communis ssp. alopex), having just 
                     a slightly wider distal pale band of the second tergum and white metasomal pubescence, 
                     prominently so on the females than that of M. communis ssp. communis. This species, 
                     although the vernacular name suggests otherwise, ranks surprisingly low in Oregonian 
                     commonality, standing at 30 current publicly available state records and only ninth most 
                     collected within the genus. Something of interest, M. communis seems to largely differ 
                     from most Melissodes in flower preference, being most often observed atop families other 
                     than Asteraceae. This species has been found across almost all of Oregon and undoubtedly 
                     occurs throughout the entire state (Fig. ??). Although collections have occurred in March, 
                     commencement of activity for M. communis seems to occur between the months of April and 
                     May, with peak activity occurring during June, July, and August (Fig. ??).

                      ♂ Sometimes a larger bee, in length, measuring 10-15mm. The flagellum is almost entirely red-colored ventrally except for the first entirely dark segment. 
                      The clypeus and labrum are bright yellow to pale (not darken marginally) and the mandibular bases have yellow maculations that are minimally wider than the 
                      triangular basal depressions and often completely cover the basal half. The first flagellar segment’s minimum length is about one-sixth of the second segment's 
                      maximum length and is also distinctly longer than the pedicle on the same side. The last two terga are entirely covered in black to dark brown hairs rather 
                      than the paler hairs that are common amongst most males. The second tergum’s distal band is narrow and usually equal to, or less than, one-half the width of 
                      the medial portion of the apical area. The vestiture is somewhat pale ochraceous to almost whitish on the metasoma. The thoracic hairs do not have a dark patch, 
                      nor do the head hairs. The wing veins are a somewhat lighter reddish brown and the leg  hairs are often pale ochraceous (similar to the thoracic hairs). The 
                      galeae are shiny with no shagreening, apart from the tips, and have widely spaced punctures with hairs dorsally arising from them. The mesoscutum is shiny with 
                      no, or delicate, shagreening and the eyes tend to be greenish.
<br><br>

                      ♀ Somewhat darker (lighter than those of M. bicoloratus but darker than those of M. agilis or M. plumosus) and larger bee, in length, measuring 12-16 mm. The 
                      underside flagellar segments 3-10 are reddish-brown to red and the metanotum is as long as, or longer than, the propodeum’s dorsal surface medially. The first 
                      tergum is usually only narrowly hyaline marginally, or not hyaline at all. The second tergum’s distal pale band is often never medially interrupted and the 
                      anterior margin of this band is straight while the posterior margin is evenly curved. The hairs on the inner surface of the hind basitarsi and tibiae are 
                      reddish-orange to yellow (not distinctly contrasting with the rest of the scopae) and the band on the second tergum is narrow and not diffuse. The apical 
                      areas of the second and third terga are not distinctly medially punctate posterior of the bands, or if there are punctures, then they are no wider than the 
                      base of the hairs that arise from them. The head hairs are mostly white to ochraceous apart from the abundant dark brown vertex hairs (these can at times be 
                      very sparse or absent entirely). The thoracic hairs are mostly pale colored (often ochraceous), but the mesoscutum has a large posteromedial patch of dark 
                      hairs (these can at times be very sparse or absent entirely, similar to those of the vertex), and the scutellar hairs are mostly dark with ochraceous to white 
                      hairs on the periphery. The tergal hairs are mostly whitish, apart from the fifth and sixth terga which are covered in black to dark brown hairs. However, the 
                      band on the fourth tergum is often medially interrupted by a small rectangular or triangular notch of suberect dark brown hairs.

                    clypeal and labral margins for the males), this in turn renders M. communis quite distinctive in Oregon with only a single other species that it’s weakly allied with, 
                    M. tepidus. Both sexes of M. communis can be separated from both sexes of M. tepidus by the narrower distal band on the second tergum.

<p style="line-height: 1.5;">
                     ♂ In M. communis the second tergum’s distal band is narrow and usually equal to, or less than, one-half the width of the medial portion of the apical area, whereas in 
                     M. tepidus, it’s equal to, or almost equals, the medial portion of the apical area. In M. communis, the fourth tergum’s pale band is clearly narrower than fourth times 
                     the medial portion of the apical area. However, in M. tepidus, this band more than, or equal to, fourth times the medial portion of the apical area. The second tergum’s 
                     distal band on M. communis can be, or almost be, as wide as the medial portion of the apical area, but the fourth tergum’s pale band is always clearly narrower than 
                     fourth times the medial portion of the apical area.</p>

                     <p style="line-height: 1.5;">
                     ♀ In M. communis, the second and third terga have somewhat narrow and thin bands (thinnest on the distal band of T2) and the apical areas of the terga are not distinctly 
                     medially punctate posterior of the bands, or if there are punctures, then they are no wider than the base of the hairs that arise from them. In M. tepidus, the bands on the 
                     second and third terga are very wide, diffusing across the tergal surface, and the apical areas, located posterior to the bands, are distinctly medially punctate, with 
                     punctures that are notably wider than the hairs that arise from them.

                     Melissodes compositus is a less common Callimelissodes that is most closely allied to M. lustrus, but is also related to M. 
                     metenuus, and M. plumosus in both sexes. Males are distinctive in the antennal structure, specifically the flagellar depressions 
                     and length of the penultimate segment, the glabrous apical tergal areas, and the sculpting of the interband zones on the second 
                     and third terga. The females are most closely related to M. lustrus and are distinctive in the sculpture of terga 1-3 and the 
                     mesoscutal, scutellar, and galeal sculpture. Historically, this species range was only known to include the states Arizona, 
                     Colorado, Montana, New Mexico, and Utah. However, collections from Idaho coupled with Nevadan, Montanan, and Northern Californian 
                     collections seem to suggest that there may be a presence of this species in Oregon (Fig. ??). For this reason, M. compositus 
                     is included within this guide. As the name suggests, M. compositus likely prefers plants from the family Asteraceae 
                     (originally called Compositae), but the paucity of floral data leaves uncertainty. As none have been collected in 
                     Oregon yet, only one line is given for the phenology graph, this line representing the range-wide phenology of this species. 
                     It seems as if M. compositus is active between the months of May and October, with peak activity occurring in August.

                      ♂ Overall, a pale bee with translucent-brown to yellow apical margins that are highly shiny and glabrous.  The underside flagellar segments 2-11 
                      are red to yellow (these segments are dark brown on top) and the mandibular bases, clypeus, and labrum (the labrum having its margin not darkened) 
                      are yellow. The eyes are bluish gray to gray, and on rare occasions, greenish blue,  the wing veins  are black to brown, and the apical areas of 
                      terga 2-5 are usually yellow-brown hyaline. The first flagellar segment’s minimum length is more than one-fifth of the second segment’s maximum 
                      length, and segments 4-10 (sometimes also on 11 and poorly defined and short on 3) have shiny, shallow, longitudinal dorsolateral depressions. 
                      The length of the penultimate segments is more than twice, but less than three times, its width and the ultimate segment’s length is approximately 
                      three times its width. The interband zones of the second and third terga have round, deep, abundant punctures that are mostly separated by 
                      noticeably less than a single puncture diameter. The head hairs are mostly dark ochraceous to pale ochraceous apart from the vertex, which often 
                      has some darker hairs. The thoracic hairs are also mostly dark ochraceous to pale ochraceous apart from the dorsal areas, which tend to bear darker 
                      hairs. The tergal hairs are mostly pale ochraceous to white, with the second, third, and fourth terga having glabrous apical areas; the fifth 
                      tergum, which reaches the apex across the entire tergum; and the sixth and seventh terga, which have some pale brown to dark ochraceous hairs, 
                      predominantly medially and basally. The legs have white to pale ochraceous hairs, differing at the inner surfaces of the tarsi, which are pale 
                      orange to yellow. 
<br><br>

                      ♀ General vestiture is somewhat pale (lighter than those of M. communis ) and the underside of F3-F10, and usually the apical area of F2 are 
                      yellow to reddish. The basal puncture on the first tergum do not exceed the basal one-third and the galeae are moderately shiny above, and delicately 
                      reticularly shagreened, but never densely tessellated. The ultimate flagellar segment is longer than its width, appearing more rounded than flattened, 
                      the pygidial plate has an elongated U-shape, and the scopal hairs are plumose. The scopal hairs are mostly pale ochraceous to white and the head 
                      hairs are often pale apart from the abundant darker vertex hairs. The thoracic hairs are laterally pale ochraceous on the lower surfaces, and mostly 
                      ochraceous to yellow on the rest of the thorax apart from the scutellum, which has medial dark brown hairs, and the mesoscutum, which has a dark 
                      brown posteromedial patch that reaches the medial portion of the tegulae. The apical tergal areas are shiny and glabrous and the galeae are somewhat 
                      shiny (comparatively so against M. metenuus and M. plumosus). The hairs on the inner surfaces of the hind basitarsi are red to yellow and the fifth 
                      and sixth terga have golden to pale brown medial hairs and large white lateral tufts of hairs. The mesoscutal punctures are coarse, and the ones 
                      positioned medially from the parapsidal line are mostly larger than of the mesepisternal or scutellar punctures; mostly separated by less than, or 
                      equal to, one-half of a puncture diameter. 
                    </p>

                    <p style="line-height: 1.5;">
                    As a result of its subtle and at times minute diagnostic characters, M. compositus can resemble a number of Oregonian Callimelissodes. The females are strongly 
                    allied to M. lustrus and M. glenwoodensis due to the shared sculpturing on the first tergum, and males are allied to these species as well due to the 
                    sculpturing of the second and third terga as well as the antennal structure. M. compositus can also resemble a few Eumelissodes due to shared vestiture 
                    coloration, but can easily be separated from these by the subgeneric characteristics. These being the convex apical margin on the fourth sternum in males 
                    along with the flagellar segment depressions, and the punctures not surpassing the basal one-third on the first tergum in the females; note that this 
                    female character is shared amongst many Callimelissodews but not all.
<p style="line-height: 1.5;">
                    ♂ Due to the apical areas of the second and third terga having simple, erect to suberect hairs, the galeae often being shiny without shagreening or delicately 
                    reticularly shagreened, and the third flagellar segment usually having a well defined ventrolateral depression, males of M. compositus are strongly allied with 
                    those of M. lustrus. M. compositus differs from M. lustrus in that the interband zones of the second and third terga have round, deep, abundant punctures that 
                    are mostly separated by noticeably less than a single puncture diameter, and the eyes are often greenish blue to blue. Whereas in M. lustrus, the interband zone 
                    of the third tergum, and usually the second as well, have punctures that are mostly separated by one puncture diameter, and several punctures that are separated 
                    by 2 to 3 puncture diameters, and the eyes are often yellowish green to green. Males can also resemble M. metenuus and M. plumosus as well due to the pale 
                    vestiture (shared by almost all males in the genus) and the length of the penultimate flagellar segment being longer than twice its width. However, M. compositus 
                    differs from these by the comparably shiny galeae, the noticeably glabrous and shiny apical tergal areas, and the coarser and more well-defined scutellar and 
                    mesoscutal punctures. 
</p>

                     <p style="line-height: 1.5;">
                     ♀ Females are interesting as they are allied with M. lustrus just as the males, but also M. glenwoodensis to an extent. This is due to the shared characteristics 
                     of the first tergum’s crowded basal punctures do not surpass the basal third or less medially (or if the medial one-third of the first tergum has punctures, then 
                     they are mostly separated by more than two puncture diameters), and the galeae are moderately shiny above, but delicately reticularly shagreened, with no dense 
                     tessellation. However, M. compositus can be quickly separated from those of M. glenwoodensis by the yellow to red hairs on the inner surfaces of the hind basitarsi 
                     (M. glenwoodensis has black to dark reddish hairs), and the pale brown medial to long white lateral hairs on the fifth and sixth sterna (M. glenwoodensis has black 
                     to dark brown hairs with no lateral tufts). Less diagnostic, but still of importance, M. glenwoodensis tends to be much larger than M. compositus, measuring 11-14 
                     mm. in length, whereas M. compositus measures 9.5-11.0 mm. in length. However, due to the characteristics M. compositus shares with M. glenwoodensis plus the hairs 
                     on the inner surfaces of the hind basitarsi being yellow to red, similar sizes, and the pale brown medial to long white lateral hairs on the fifth and sixth sterna, 
                     M. lustrus bears a striking resemblance, and is more closely allied to, M. compositus. M. compositus can be separated from M. lustrus by the mesoscutal punctures 
                     positioned medially from the parapsidal line, which are mostly larger than the scutellar or mesepisternal punctures, and are mostly separated by less than, or equal 
                     to, one puncture diameter. In M. lustrus, these punctures are of irregular size, usually smaller than the majority of the mesepisternal or scutellar punctures, 
                     and mostly separated by more than one-half of a puncture diameter (several separated by more than, or equal to, two puncture diameters). Females can resemble M. 
                     plumosus because of the same vestiture coloration, but largely differ in the first tergum punctation (M. plumosus has punctures that exceed the basal one-half) 
                     and the galeal sculpting (M. plumosus has densely tessellate galeae whereas M. compositus has no tessellation).

Due to the few available flower records, a strict statement of oligolecty seems unfounded. However, with the current known data, it seems as though M. compositus may have a 
preference for Asteraceae (or historically known as Compositae) flowers (Laberge, 1961), but more reports are needed to be certain. All flower records included in this list 
are from reports in the literature or datasets. Each flower has a parenthesized reference listed after it, corresponding to the literary work or dataset in which it was recorded. 
Currently, M. compositus has been collected atop Aster sp. (Laberge, 1961), Gossypium thurberi (Laberge, 1961; old synonym), Grindelia sp. (Laberge, 1961), Grindelia squarrosa 
(Laberge, 1961), Haplopappus gracilis (Laberge, 1961).

                <p style="line-height: 1.5;">
                     Melissodes dagosus is one of, if not the most, distinctive Melissodes in Oregon. This is due to the subgenus in which it resides (Apomelissodes, 
                     originally Tachymelissodes) has only one Oregonian representative (M. dagosus). So not only can species-specific characters be used to identify M. 
                     dagosus in Oregon, but entire subgeneric traits are viable as well. As the subgenus M. Tachymelissodes was absorbed into M. Apomelissodes (Freitas 
                     et al., 2023), and M. dagosus specifically was found to be more closely allied with M. Apomelissodes instead of M. Tachymelissodes (Wright, et al., 
                     2020), subgeneric characters for the combination of the two subgenera don’t completely overlap anymore. Herein, when referring to the subgeneric 
                     characters of M. dagosus, these will instead be referencing those of M. Tachymelissodes rather than M. Apomelissodes for ease of use. Although this 
                     species is the most common in its original subgenus (M. Tachymelissodes), in general, M. dagosus seems as if it may be a rarer bee, especially 
                     compared to other M. Eumelissodes. Unexpectedly, M. dagosus actually ranks as the ninth most common species amongst the rest of the genus in Oregon, 
                     with a total of 32 records (Fig. 13). This species has been found across the South to Central Eastern areas in Oregon (Fig. ??), and given its 
                     inland presence in California and Arizona, it seems as though this may be the most westward of its range in Oregon. M. dagosus was originally 
                     thought to be active between the months of May and August with peak activity occurring in June and July (Laberge, 1956b). However, more recent 
                     collections suggest this same sentiment, except peak activity seems to more prominently occur in June (Fig. ??).

                    <p style="line-height: 1.5;">
                      ♂ A pale-colored bee, somewhat white to silvery in color, measuring to be 8-11 mm. in length. The underside of flagellar segments 2-11 and often the 
                      apex of 1 are orange to yellow and the minimum length of the first flagellar segment is approximately more than, or equal to, one-half of the second 
                      second segment's maximum length. The width of the penultimate flagellar segment is around two thirds its width, and in repose, the antennae reach the 
                      basal area of the first tergum. The clypeal punctures then to be somewhat elongate (noticeably so basally), but smaller than those of the female. 
                      The pubescent bands on terga 2-5 are positioned apically, approximately the same width across each respective terga (not widening or narrowing), and 
                      approximately the same width as the other tergal bands. The clypeus  is mostly pale yellow apart from the darkened spots denoting the tentorial 
                      depressions and the labrum is mostly cream colored, but becomes dark brown marginally. The mandibular bases usually have triangular macula that are 
                      often somewhat small (very rarely absent) and the wing veins are black to dark reddish brown. The head hairs are almost completely pale with only 
                      a few brown hairs on the vertex occasionally and the thoracic hairs are mostly pale and only have a few brown hairs on the posteromedial mesoscutal 
                      area and the medial scutellar area occasionally. The tergal vestiture description is as follows: The basal three-fifths of the first tergum bear 
                      long white basal hairs. The basal pale pubescent band of the second tergum is white to silver-colored as is the distal band, and the distal band 
                      is complete and usually medially reaches the apical margin. The interband zone of the second tergum bears short, subappressed, brown hairs. The 
                      third and fourth terga are similar to that of the second, differing at the dark brown basal tomentum. The fifth tergum’s pale band is similar to 
                      that of the fourth tergum. The sixth and seventh terga are covered in long pale hairs.
<br><br>

                      ♀ Generally a paler bee (around the same color as those of M. plumosus), medium in size measuring 10-12 mm. in length. The underside of flagellar 
                      segments 3-10 and often the apex of 2 are dark red to yellow and the eyes are greenish blue to blue. The clypeal punctures then to be somewhat 
                      elongate (noticeably so basally) and the distal bands on terga 2-4 are approximately the same width across each terga (not narrowing or widening), 
                      reach the apex across the entire tergum, and around as narrow, or narrower, than the basal dark pubescence. The scopal hairs have 3-6 branches on 
                      either side of each rachis and the pygidial plate is somewhat V-shaped. The head hairs are mostly white to silver-colored with some brown hairs on 
                      the vertex and labrum (in the darkest individuals, the dark hairs are dark brown; in the lightest individuals, these hairs are more ochraceous on 
                      the labrum and lighter brown on the vertex). However, in dark specimens, the dark brown head hairs can also be found on the clypeus and mandibles 
                      as well. The thoracic hairs are mostly pale yellow to white (entirely white on the propodeum) apart from the large dark brown posteromedial 
                      mesoscutal patch of sparse hairs that reaches the medial areas of the tegulae, the medial often dark scutellar hairs, and usually the dark anterior, 
                      ventral, and lateral mesepisternal hairs (these can be entirely pale). The tergal vestiture description is as follows: The basal three-fifths of 
                      the first tergum bear long white basal hairs. The basal pale pubescent band of the second tergum is white to silver-colored as is the distal band, 
                      and the distal band is often narrowly medially interrupted. The distal pale band is also separated from the apical margin, maximally in the medial 
                      one-third and often less, by a narrowed area of simple brown short hairs when not worn. The interband zone of the second tergum bears short, 
                      subappressed, brown hairs. The third and fourth terga are similar to that of the second, differing at the dark brown basal tomentum and the apically 
                      positioned, uninterrupted distal pale pubescent bands (not separated from the apical margin by simple brown short hairs). The fifth and sixth terga 
                      are mostly covered in long, dark brown, appressed hairs, except for paler individuals which have lateral ochraceous to white pale tufts of hairs.

                    <p style="line-height: 1.5;">
                    As stated above, only a single species of M. Apomelissodes resides in Oregon, that being M. dagosus. Given how incredibly distinctive it is, unnecessary 
                    comparisons between species will be omitted and instead replaced by diagnostic characters for each sex. These traits can also be seen in both the 
                    descriptions and dichotomous keys, but are reiterated here for ease of use.

<p style="line-height: 1.5;">
                    ♂ The first flagellar segment is approximately more than, or equal to, one-half of the second second segment's maximum length and the bands on terga 2-5 are 
                    positioned apically. The only species that can somewhat resemble M. dagosus is M. rivalis due to a similarly lengthy F1, however, M. rivalis does not have tergal 
                    bands that reach the apex across the entire tergum. Furthermore, M. rivalis has a largely protuberant clypeus that protrudes beyond the eye by three-fourths of an 
                    eye's width in profile or more, whereas M. dagosus’ clypeus protrudes beyond the eye, but by less than three-fourths of an eye's width in profile.

                     <p style="line-height: 1.5;">
                     ♀ The second, third, and fourth terga have distal pale bands that reach the apex across the entire tergum, are approximately the same width across each terga 
                     (not narrowing or widening), are the same width to one another, and around as narrow, or narrower, than the basal dark pubescence on each tergum. The hairs 
                     of these bands do not arise from noticeable punctures.

                    <p style="line-height: 1.5;">
A stark change from the rest of the genus, M. dagosus seems to be a highly polylectic species (Laberge, 1956b). This species has been found collecting both pollen and 
nectar from multiple families, including Asteraceae, but only on the genus Cirsium (thistles). More data is required to make a definitive statement on flower preference, 
but with the current known records, M. dagosus may be a generalist.  All flower records included in this list are from reports in the literature or datasets. Each flower 
has a parenthesized reference listed after it, corresponding to the literary work or dataset in which it was recorded. Currently, M. dagosus has been collected atop 
Asclepias sp. (Laberge, 1956b), Cirsium sp. (Laberge, 1956b), Medicago sativa (Laberge, 1956b), Melilotus sp. (Laberge, 1956b), Melilotus officinalis (Laberge, 1956b; 
old synonym), Sisymbrium altissimum (Laberge, 1956b; old synonym), Sphaeralcea sp. (Laberge, 1956b), Thelypodium brachycarpum (Laberge, 1956b).

                     Melissodes druriellus, Drury's long-horned bee, is closely allied to M. pallidisignatus and one of the most variable Melissodes 
                     in the female sex. The males are most similar to M. pallidisignatus, but are distinctive in the opaque to deeply infumate apical tergal 
                     margins. Females are interesting given their variability across their entire range, and as none have yet to be found in Oregon but 
                     likely occur in this state, it's unknown what the general coloration in Oregon is. The rule presented by Laberge (1956a) states that Melissodes 
                     typically bear a paler vestiture in the Western and Southwestern areas of North America and a darker vestiture in the east. However, many of 
                     the examples used to support this were derived from subgenera that no longer reside within the genus (notably Epimelissodes), which calls 
                     into question the viability of this general rule for the modern-day genus. Also, many of the species-specific exceptions made to this 
                     statement belong to valid current-day subgenera (e.g. Eumelissodes and Melissodes s.s.) with species such as M. tepidus, an Oregonian 
                     resident, showing no real melanistic changes in its southern subspecies in comparison to its northern and eastern counterparts (Laberge, 1956a). 
                     With all of this being said, it’s currently unknown what color variations of the females of M. druriellus exist in Oregon, and as shown in 
                     Laberge (1961), many may exist within a similar region. Therefore, a general description of females will be provided below based mostly on 
                     sculptural characters with an emphasis that color variability is often common and isn’t necessary diognostic. Females are also most closely 
                     allied with M. pallidisignatus in Oregon due to the same shared dark mesoscutal hair patch, the impunctate shiny apical areas on the second 
                     tergum, the dull interband zone of the second tergum (highly contrasts with the shiny apical areas), and the abundant dark hairs on the tegulae 
                     and vertex. Females of M. druriellus are separated from those of M. pallidisignatus by the distal band on the third tergum, the rusty-reddish 
                     mesoscutal hairs on the areas anterior to the dark patch, and the sculpture of the first tergum. As stated above, M. druriellus has yet to be 
                     collected in Oregon, however, its current known range suggests that it may have a presence in this region (Fig. ??), and is therefore 
                     included in this guide. This species was historically believed to be active from May to November with peak activity occurring in August 
                     (Laberge, 1961) , and newer data seems to reflect this apart from a recent singular collection in April (Gibbs, 2025) implying that yearly 
                     activity commencement may start earlier than originally recognized.

                    <p style="line-height: 1.5;">♂ Generally a pale ochraceous to yellow bee with a yellow clypeus (marginally darkened) and gray, greenish yellow, 
                      or greenish blue eyes. The wing veins are reddish brown and the labrum is black with a mediobasal pale spot. The underside of flagellar 
                      segments 2-11 tend to be orange-colored and the apical areas of the terga are always brownish red. The length of the penultimate segment 
                      is usually less than, or equal to, one-third of its length and when in repose, but in some individuals, the penultimate flagellar segment’s 
                      length is greater than one-third of its width. When in repose, the flagella usually reach, or barely surpass the pterostigma, but in some 
                      individuals, this is not the case; widely variable. The first flagellar segment’s minimum length is approximately one-fourth to one-sixth 
                      of the second segment’s maximum length. The basal areas of terga 4-6 are covered in reddish brown pubescence and the mandibular bases do not 
                      have yellow maculations. Similarly to the females, the males also vary in color, but to a lesser extent. As stated by Laberge (1961), a 
                      similar format addressing variation in males is omitted due to many morphs occupying similar areas. Instead, a generic description, pertaining 
                      to all males, was given and will herein be what this setal description references. The hairs on the head are mostly yellow to pale ochraceous 
                      apart from the vertex, which usually has a few brown hairs. The thoracic hairs are mostly yellow to pale ochraceous as well, but the scutellar, 
                      tegular, and mesoscutal hairs are often brown. The tergal vestiture is as follows: the first tergum has long basal white to ochraceous hairs 
                      and long appressed to subappressed apical pale hairs that reach the apex across the tergum but don’t obscure the medial portion of the apical 
                      area (sometimes these hairs don’t obscure the apical margin more than medially); the second tergum has white basal pubescence and partially to 
                      entirely dark suberect, bristle-like hairs on the interband zone; the distal pubescent band of the second tergum is posteriorly separated from 
                      the apex of the tergum by about one-half to one times the length of the medial area of the pale band and is not interrupted medially; terga 
                      3-5 are similar to that of the second tergum except for the interband zones, which in addition to the bristle-like hairs, they often bear 
                      delicate, sparse, white, appressed pubescence; the distal bands of terga 3-4 become closer to the apical margin with each tergum and the basal 
                      tomentum resembles a dark chocolate color; the fourth tergum’s distal pale band also tends to be medially interrupted and the fifth tergum’s 
                      distal pale band is usually absent altogether; the sixth and seventh terga are covered in dark brown hairs apart from the lateral pale tufts.</p>

                    <p style="line-height: 1.5;">♀ Highly variable in vestiture coloration, most often a somewhat pale bee with rusty red hairs anterior to the 
                      dark mesoscutal patch. The eyes are greenish blue to gray and the wing veins are black to dark brown. The underside of flagellar segments 
                      3-10 are rufescent and the apical areas of terga 1-3 are black to dark brownish red. The terga do not have their pubescent bands complete 
                      but instead they are lateral fasciae, or sometimes entirely absent. If one of the tergal bands is complete, then it’s the second tergum’s 
                      band and the hairs on the lower lateral mesepisternal surfaces are dark brown; or the terga have their pubescent bands complete on more 
                      than just one tergum. If however there is just one complete band on a single tergum, then it’s either not on the first tergum, or the hairs 
                      on the lower lateral mesepisternal surfaces aren’t dark. This is dependent on the morph. The distal band on the third tergum is separated 
                      from the tergum’s apical margin and The first tergum is densely reticularly shagreened and the punctures are incredibly shallow, large, 
                      and crowded. These punctures are usually obscured by the shagreening. The apical areas of the second tergum tend to be shiny and the 
                      interband zone tends to be dulled, highly contrasting to the apical area. The clypeus tends to be non-protuberant, in profile, only protruding 
                      beyond the eye by usually less than one-half of an eye’s width.</p>

                      <p style="line-height: 1.5;">Due to its variability, an entire setal description along with its modifiers for melanism seems appropriate. 
                        The description below is derived and expanded from that of Laberge (1961) and represents the palest morph; the starting point for 
                        further melanistic additions. The head hairs are mostly ochraceous to white apart from the vertex, which bears brown hairs. The thoracic 
                        hairs are ochraceous to white, usually a pale rusty-red color anterior of the dark mesoscutal patch, apart from the large mesoscutal 
                        dark patch that’s often larger, or at least as large as, the scutellar dark patch. The first tergum’s basal three-fifths or more bear 
                        ochraceous to yellow hairs. The basal pubescent band on the second tergum is pale ochraceous to white and the interband zone has mostly 
                        black, suberect hairs. The distal pale pubescent band of the second tergum is often narrowly medially interrupted, does not reach the 
                        apical margin laterally, and takes on a yellow to ochraceous hue. The apical areas of the second tergum located near the distal pale band 
                        tend to bear short, sparse, subappressed hairs laterally. The third tergum is similar to that of the second, but the basal tomentum is 
                        dark brown and dense, and the distal pale pubescent band is uninterrupted. The fourth tergum’s distal pale pubescent band reaches the apex 
                        across the entire tergum, is narrower than the basal dark tomentum, and is complete. The fifth and sixth terga are mostly covered in dark 
                        hairs, but laterally, small tufts of pale hairs are present. The leg hairs are mostly pale ochraceous, differing at the fore and middle 
                        tarsi, which are dark brown; the scopal hairs, which are often yellow; the inner surfaces of the hind basitarsi and hind tibiae, which are 
                        dark brown; the basitibial plate, which is brown; the outer surfaces of the fore and middle tibiae, which are dark brown; and the tibiae 
                        as well as the upper areas of the hind femora sometimes, which are also dark brown. In general, the darkest females tend to be almost 
                        entirely black to dark brown with a few pale hairs on the periphery of the mesoscutum, the wing bases, and the pronotal lobes. Along with 
                        this, the scopae also tend to be yellow. </p>

                         <p style="line-height: 1.5;">
                          Many levels of melanism seem to exist within females of M. druriellus, and these differences are gradual rather than stark. As the geographical 
                          variation in melanism is unknown for M. druriellus females in Oregon, all possible morphs will be accounted for.  In his treatment, Laberge 
                          (1961) categorized three (presented as a, b, and c) “levels” of melanism across 8 morphological features (e.g. tergal band color, leg hair 
                          color, ect.). This resulted in a list allowing for variation accountability rather than writing singular descriptions for each 
                          theoretical variety (6, 561 or 3^8 possible morphs). A similar structure derived from Laberge’s (1961) findings will be presented here as a table. The table below lists eight characters along with three melanistic levles per character that can vary from the palest description (table 3).
                          These traits are meant to be applied to, and override portions of, the pale descriptions above.
                           Note that each value per character (light, intermediate, or dark) 
                          is independent from one another. Therefore, a female M. druriellus may have no brown pubescence on the fourth tergum (palest choice for the 
                          first character), and also have all dark hairs on the legs except for the scopal hairs and sometimes the anterior femoral surfaces (darkest 
                          choice for the eighth character).

                    Males and females of Melissodes druriellus are highly variable if not apparent from their descriptions. Females can resemble a number of 
                    different species because of how wide their setal coloration ranges. Males are interesting in that their structure as well as their vestiture 
                    coloration varies, but even with this taken into consideration, they are still highly distinctive. As can be seen in the key above (couplet 18), 
                    males of M. druriellus are split into two separate groups: 1) the males with the length of their penultimate flagellar segment equal to, or less 
                    than, three times its width and the antennae does not surpass the pterostigma in repose; 2) males with the length of their penultimate flagellar 
                    segment more than three times its length and/or the antennae surpass the pterostigma in repose. For this reason, two male treatments will be given. 
                    Given how the coloration and structure of the female vestiture is rather gradual than abrupt, two treatments for dark and light morphs (as seen 
                    in the M. bimatris treatment) wouldn’t suffice. Instead, a single comparison highlighting diagnostic characteristics and a few species of high 
                    resemblance based on a given morph will be presented.</p>

<p style="line-height: 1.5;">
                   ♂ (1) This grouping of M. druriellus males are most similar to those of M. pallidisignatus. Similar to the males of M. druriellus, M. pallidisignatus 
                   have two separate groups as well, however these fall under the same umbrella as group one of M. druriellus males. That is, that the length of the 
                   penultimate flagellar segment is less than three times its width (maximum length and narrowest width) and the antennae does not surpass the pterostigma 
                   in repose. The groups of M. pallidisignatus are as follows: 1) the mandibular bases have yellow macula; 2) the mandibular bases are entirely black. 
                   Group one of M. druriellus males differs from group one of M. pallidisignatus males in that the mandibular bases are entirely black, and differs from 
                   both groups of M. pallidisignatus males by the dark apical tergal areas (M. pallidisignatus’ tergal areas are colorless to testaceous or brownish yellow 
                   hyaline).

<p style="line-height: 1.5;">
♂ (2) This grouping of M. druriellus males aren’t specifically similar to any single species and are highly distinc in Oregon. This is because M. druriellus males 
are the only Oregonian resident within Eumelissodes to have opaque brown-red apical tergal margins.

                     <p style="line-height: 1.5;">
♀ Superizingly, females often only resemble one or two other species in Oregon, but seem to be most closely allied with those of M. pallidisignatus. M. druriellus can be 
separated by the distal band on the third tergum, which does not reach the apex across the entire tergum and is instead well-separated from it (on M. pallidisignatus, 
this band usually reaches the apex of the tergum laterally); the pale hairs on the mesoscutum positioned anteriorly to the dark patch of hairs, which are usually 
rusty-reddish (often pale ochraceous to white in M. pallidisignatus); the first tergum, which is densely reticularly shagreened and the punctures are incredibly 
shallow, large, and crowded (the punctures are distinct in M. pallidisignatus). In its darkest form, M. druriellus can also resemble M. pullatellus. The two differ 
significantly in their scopal hair coloration. That being in M. druriellus, the scopal hairs are often yellow to golden, whereas in M. pullatellus, these hairs are 
dark brown to black.

                    <p style="line-height: 1.5;">
M. druriellus is a known oligolege of Asteraceae, and according to the flower records presented by Laberge (1961) M. druriellus seems to have a strong preference toward the genera Aster, 
Solidago, Gindeliae, and Aplopappus. However, in Western areas (likely including Oregon), M. druriellus seems to prefer Solidago (Laberge, 1961). According to Laberge (1961), of the 420 M. 
druriellus collected with floral accounts, 130 were found atop Solidago, 109 were found atop aster, 51 were found atop Grindelia, and 28 were found atop Aplopappus; the rest were collected 
across scattered genera with no substantial values. This is in agreement to the statement made above, but interestingly, Aster seems to be a very close second behind Solidago. Given how 
close Solidago and Aster are in preference, two percentages will be given. This data renders Solidago to be favored 30.95% of the time, and Aster to be favored 25.95% of the time by M. 
druriellus.

                <p style="line-height: 1.5;">
                    Melissodes glenwoodensis is a quite distinctive bee, in part due to it being the largest of its genus in Oregon. Interestingly, both males and females are 
                    allied with M. lustrus, and to an extent M. composistus, but males share a more similar antennal structure to that of M. lupinus and M. nigracauda than 
                    the foregoing species. The males are distinctive in that flagellar segments 5-9 (sometimes on then, never on 11) have shiny depressions, the apical areas 
                    of the second and third terga are glabrous as well as impunctate, and the galeae are either shiny or dull due to shagreening. Females are distinctive in 
                    that the basal crowded punctures on the first tergum does not surpass the basal one-third, the hairs on the inner surfaces of the hind basitarsi are black 
                    to dark reddish brown and the scopal hairs are usually yellow, and the fifth and sixth terga have black to dark brown hairs or no white lateral tufts. 
                    Although, as stated above, males are similar to M. lupinus, females seem to not partake in this allyship. Rather, the two species in the female sex differ 
                    greatly from one in other by the ultimate flagellar segment structure. M. glenwoodensis has been found in the Northeastern and Southwestern areas of Oregon 
                    and given how widespread these collections are, likely occurs across the entire state (Fig. ??). A total of five records comprise its Oregonian range, 
                    placing this species as the fifth rarest within the genus for this region. M. glenwoodensis was historically presumed to be active between the months of 
                    July and November, but most chiefly so in August and September (Laberge, 1961). New found data currently suggests that this species is active between the 
                    months of May and November, with September noticeably out-performing August in terms of abundance (Fig. ??).

                    <p style="line-height: 1.5;">
                     ♂ A paler bee with darker wing veins (darker than those of M. agilis) and somewhat similar to M. lupinus and M. compositus. The clypeus, mandibular bases, 
                     and labrum are yellow, and the labrum isn’t marginally darkened. The eyes are often grayish green to green and the underside flagellar segments 2-11 are red 
                     to yellow (these segments are dark brown on top). The wing veins  are black to brown and terga 2-5 are sometimes yellow hyaline apically, but usually opaque 
                     brown. The first flagellar segment’s minimum length is approximately equal to one-fourth of the second segment’s maximum length, and segments 5-10 (sometimes 
                     also on the apex of 4) have shiny, shallow, longitudinal dorsolateral depressions. The length of the penultimate segments is more than twice, but less than 
                     three times, its width and the ultimate segment’s length is approximately three times its width. The apical areas of the second and third terga are glabrous 
                     as well as impunctate and the galeae are either shiny or dull due to shagreening. The fourth sternum is marginally convex, and the fifth and third sterna are 
                     very feebly convex marginally, almost transverse. Males tend not to vary in setal coloration, the description of which follows: the head hairs are mostly 
                     dark ochraceous to pale ochraceous apart from the vertex, which often has some darker hairs; the thoracic hairs are also mostly dark ochraceous to pale 
                     ochraceous apart from the dorsal areas, which tend to bear darker hairs; the tergal hairs are mostly white, with the second, third, and fourth terga having 
                     glabrous apical areas, the fifth tergum, which is separated from the apex across the entire tergum, and the sixth and seventh terga, which have their surfaces 
                     largely covered in dark brown hairs; the sternal hairs are usually medially brown. 

<br><br>

                     ♀ Generally a large bee (largest individuales in Oregon are of this species) covered in pale hairs with very striking banding. Two color variations are 
                     present in the female sex (light and dark), but the differences between the two are somewhat minute. Herein, this description accounts for all variability. 
                     The eyes are greenish blue to gray and the wing membranes are faintly infumate. The wing veins are black to dark brown and the underside of flagellar 
                     segments 3-10 are rufescent. The apical one-half of the mandibles are rufescent and the apical areas of terga 1-3 are black to dark brownish red. The first 
                     tergum’s crowded basal punctures are restricted to, and do not surpass, the basal third or less medially. If the medial one-third of the first tergum has 
                     punctures, then they are mostly separated by more than two puncture diameters. The galeae are moderately shiny above, and delicately reticularly shagreened, 
                     but not densely tessellated. The hairs on the inner surfaces of the hind basitarsi are black to dark reddish brown and the scopal hairs are usually yellow. 
                     The tergal vestiture is as follows: the basal and extreme lateral areas of the first tergum bear pale ochraceous to white hairs; the basal pale pubescent band 
                     on the second tergum is white and complete and the distal pale band on is instead is reduced to white, narrow, oblique, lateral, fasciae that are laterally 
                     spaced from the apex of the tergum, minimally by the length of the fascia at that area; in width, the fasciae of the second tergum are somewhat wider than the 
                     apubescent medial portion of the tergum; the basal tomentum of the third tergum is dark brown, the interband zone bears scattered white to brown pubescence 
                     (these hairs often become browner near the basal area), and the distal pale pubescent band does not reach the apical margin across the entire tergum; the fourth 
                     tergum is similar to that of the third, differing at the distal pubescent band, which is complete and reaches the apex across the entire tergum; the fifth and 
                     sixth terga are mostly covered in black to dark brown hairs apart from the lateral long pale ochraceous to white lateral tufts of hair; sometimes these tufts 
                     are absent on the sixth tergum.

                    </p>

                     <h3 class="sub-heading" style="font-size: 18px;"><b><i>Similar Species</i></b></h3>
                    <p style="line-height: 1.5;">
                   As specified above, M. glenwoodensis is most similar to M. compositus and M. lustrus in the female sex due to the shared sculpturing on the first tergum. The 
                   males on the other hand seem to be related to the foregoing species, but most closely allied to M. lupinus males due to the shared antennal structure. As with most 
                   Melissodes, the males of this species can superficially resemble a number of others due to the shared vestiture coloration. However, as they are within the subgenus 
                   Callimelissodes, males can quickly be separated from any other subgenus in that the fourth sternum is marginally convex rather than transverse. Females are 
                   distinctive in the sculpture of the first tergum (this trait is only shared amongst 3 females in Oregon) and the setal coloration on the inner surfaces of the 
                   hind basitarsi.</p>


<p style="line-height: 1.5;">
                    ♂ Similarly to the females, M. glenwoodensis males are similar to those of M. lustrus and M. compositus. However, in the male sex, this species vastly differs 
                    from both M. lustrus and M. compositus due to the lack of flagellar depressions on F4 and F11 (see couplet 3 in the male key). For this reason, M. glenwoodensis 
                    males more strongly resemble those of M. lupinus. Males can be separated from M. lupinus by the apical areas of the second and third terga, which are glabrous 
                    as well as impunctate; and the galeae, which are either shiny or dull due to shagreening. In contrast, the apical areas of T2 and T3 on M. lupinus bear suberect 
                    hairs and the galeae are often dull due to dense shagreening. Due to the distinctive flagellar segmentation and subgeneric characteristics (the structure of S4), M. glenwoodensis 
                    does not directly resemble any other Melissodes in Oregon.

</p>

                     <p style="line-height: 1.5;">
                     ♀ Females of M. glenwoodensis are most similar to M. compositus and M. lustrus, but most likely the latter more so than the former. These species form somewhat of a 
                     “morphological clade” in that no other Melissodes share their characteristic of the crowded basal punctures on T1 no surpassing the basal one-third or less medially. 
                     Interestingly, within this grouping, M. lustrus seems to be more closely allied to M. compositus than M. glenwoodensis and vice versa. Hence, M. glenwoodensis is 
                     separated from both these species due to the hairs on the inner surfaces of the hind basitarsi being black to dark reddish brown (highly contrasting with the scopal hairs) 
                     and the scopal hairs being usually yellow (see couplet 14 of the female key). In contrast, M. compositus and M. lustrus have red to yellow hairs on the inner surfaces of 
                     the hind basitarsi (not highly contrasting with the scopal hairs) and the scopae are often more pale ochraceous to white. On top of this, females further differ from both 
                     these species due to their size. M. glenwoodensis ranges between 11-14 mm. in length, whereas M. compositus and M. lustrus range between 9-12 mm. in length; M. compositus 
                     often does not surpass 11 mm.

                    <p style="line-height: 1.5;">
M. glenwoodensis is apparently an oligolect of Asteraceae, and according to the flower records presented by Laberge (1961), This seems to have a strong preference toward the genus Chrysothamnus. 
According to Laberge (1961), a total of 146 M. glenwoodensis collections with floral data available have been accounted for. These bees were collected across 29 dedicated searches, 20 of which all 
bees were found atop Chrysothamnus (Laberge, 1961). Assuming all collections resulted in a similar number of specimens, this renders Chrysothamnus to be favored 68.96% of the time by M. glenwoodensis. 
However, for this to be true, a possibly inaccurate assumption must be made given the numerical data is unpublished, so this is just a speculatory estimation.

                    Melissodes grindeliae is closely allied to M. druriellus and M. pallidisignatus, but females differ largely in the tergal and scopal hair coloration, and 
                    males differ in the wider tergal bands and shorter F1. Similarly to those of M. druriellus and M. pallidisignatus, males of M. grindeliae have two seperate 
                    groups that it can be classified into. This is interesting as all species within the druriellus group (M. druriellus, M. pallidisignatus, and M. grindeliae) 
                    both occur or likely occur in Oregon, and share this same structural and integumental binomial variation in the male sex. Although just speculatory, this is 
                    possibly a result of a shared similar ancestor that originally resided in Oregon, from which these species diverged. Males of M. grindeliae are distinctive 
                    in two manners: group 1) The length of the penultimate flagellar segment is less than three times its width (maximum length and narrowest width) and the 
                    antennae reach but do not surpass the pterostigma in repose; the labrum and the mandibles are black without yellow maculations. Group 2) The first flagellar 
                    egment’s maximum length is more than one-third of the third segment’s minimum length; the mesoscutal and scutellar hairs are abundantly dark medially. 
                    Females are distinctive in that the tergal bands are often yellow to ochraceous, predominantly so on T3 and T4; the scopal hairs are often ochraceous; the 
                    distal band on T3 reaches the apex laterally; and the second flagellar segment’s length is less than or equal to its width. Counter intuitively, M. grindeliae 
                    (although an Asteraceae oligolege) does not specialize on, and isn’t restricted to, flowers from the genus Gindelia. In fact, this genera seems to make up a 
                    very small portion of its floral data (see more in “Flower Preferance”). This species has yet to be found in Oregon, but given the estimated distribution map 
                    from Laberge (1961), and more recent distribution data (Fig. ??), M. grindeliae likely occurs in Oregon. Furthermore, given its coastal presence in California 
                    coupled with abundant inland documentations (as well as the Washington record from Laberge, 1961; omitted in Fig. ?? due to unknown coordinates), it's probable 
                    that M. grindeliae is present across the entirety of Oregon. This species seems to be active between the months of June and September, with peak activity 
                    occurring in July, an observation presented by Laberge (1961) and further supported in Fig. ??.

                    <p style="line-height: 1.5;">
                     ♂ A pale bee with darker hairs on the dorsal thoracic areas and hyaline tergal margins. The clypeus is mostly yellow apart from the piceous to rufescent apical 
                     margin and the eyes are yellowish brown to green. The wing membranes are colorless hyaline to faintly infumate and the wing veins are dark brown to reddish brown. 
                     The minimum length of the first flagellar segment is approximately one-third of the second segment’s maximum length, and the length of the penultimate flagellar 
                     segment is less than, or equal to, three times its width. When in repose, the flagella reach, or almost reach, the pterostigma. The labrum and the mandibles are 
                     black and have no yellow maculations. Two variations of M. grindeliae males are present, some where the length of the penultimate flagellar segment is less than 
                     three times its width (maximum length and narrowest width) and the antennae does not surpass the pterostigma in repose, and others the opposite (see couplet 18 
                     in the male key). However, if an individual presents the characteristics of the latter, the hairs on the mesoscutum always have a dark patch. In the case of the 
                     former, the mesoscutal hairs can be entirely pale or have a dark patch. The tergal vestiture is as follows: the hairs on the first tergum are entirely ochraceous; 
                     the basal area of the second tergum bears pale ochraceous hairs and the interband zone is covered with erect and partially pale hairs; the second tergum’s distal 
                     pale pubescent band is faintly yellow to ochraceous, laterally connected to the basal pale band by pale hairs, often uninterrupted and becoming medially narrowed, 
                     and usually reaches the apical margin at extreme lateral areas; when unworn, the apical area of the second tergum bears many suberect, often brown, and long hairs 
                     (longer than that of the female). The third and fourth terga are similar to that of the second apart from the interband zones, which have entirely to partially 
                     brown hairs; and the distal pale pubescent bands, which reach the apical margin, minimally laterally and sometimes more; the fourth tergum’s distal pubescent 
                     band also usually reaches the apex across the entire tergum. The fifth tergum is similar to that of the fourth, but the apical area is entirely obscured by the 
                     distal band; the sixth and seventh terga are basally covered in brown hairs, but apically, these hairs become yellow.
                    <br><br>
                     ♀ Generally a pale bee with a distinct large dark patch of hairs on the mesoscutum and scutellum (somewhat reminiscent of M. druriellus). The eyes are greenish 
                     gray to blue and the underside of flagellar segments 3-10 are rufescent (very noticeably so on the distal most three or four segments). The wing veins are black 
                     to brown and the apical margin of the first tergum is very narrowly hyaline. The interband zone of the second tergum is impuncate or essentially so and has erect 
                     to suberect dark hairs. The hairs on the inner surfaces of the hind basitarsi are black to dark reddish brown. The apical areas of the second, third, and fourth 
                     terga are piceous to opaque and dark brown. The length of the second flagellar segment is less than, or equal to, its width. The head hairs are mostly pale 
                     ochraceous to white apart from the vertex, which has abundant dark brown hairs. The thoracic hairs are pale ochraceous to somewhat yellowish except as follows: 
                     the lateral thoracic areas are pale ochraceous to white, but the mesepisternal hairs are sometimes brown on the lower lateral, ventral, and anterior surfaces; 
                     the scutellar hairs are dark brown apart from the pale hairs on its periphery; the mesoscutum has a posteromedal dark patch of hairs that reaches the anterior 
                     tegular margins and often surpasses them. The tergal vestiture is generally yellow to ochraceous (notably so on T3 and T4) and the descriptions are as follows: 
                     the basal area of the first tergum bears yellowish to ochraceous hairs; the basal area of the second tergum bears pale ochraceous hairs and the interband zone is 
                     covered with dark brown pubescence; the second tergum’s distal pale pubescent band is faintly yellow to ochraceous, laterally connected to the basal pale band by 
                     pale hairs, often uninterrupted and becoming medially narrowed, and usually reaches the apical margin at extreme lateral areas; when unworn, the apical area of the 
                     second tergum bears many brown to ochraceous, comparably simple, suberect, long hairs; the third tergum is similar to that of the second tergum apart from the 
                     distal band, which reaches the apical margin laterally and is faintly yellow-colored, and the basal tomentum, which is dark brown; the fourth tergum’s distal pale 
                     band reaches the apex across the entire tergum, is complete, often vibrant yellowish to near orange, and doesn't noticeably widen or narrow; the fifth and sixth 
                     tergum are mostly covered in dark hairs apart from the lateral tufts, which are white.

                    <p style="line-height: 1.5;">
                      As shown in the group name and the overview, M. grindeliae are similar to M. druriellus and M. pallidisignatus in both sexes. In males, two groups of M. 
                      grindeliae (described above) exist, each one more closely allied with one species than another. In group 1, the males of M. grindeliae are most similar to 
                      both M. pallidisignatus and the first grouping of M. druriellus (see grouping in respective species description) due to the shared characteristics of the 
                      length of the penultimate flagellar segment being less than three times its width (maximum length and narrowest width) and the antennae not surpassing the 
                      pterostigma in repose. However, in group two of M. grindeliae, these individuals seem to be more closely allied with group two of M. druriellus. This is as 
                      a result of the shared characteristic pertaining to the length of the penultimate flagellar segment being equal to or more than, three times its width (maximum 
                      length and narrowest width). Taking into account these two groups, two treatments will be listed for the males of M. grindeliae in this similar species section. 
                      Females, unlike males, have only one distinct form and most strongly resemble M. pallidisignatus, and lesser so M. microstictus and M. druriellus. </p>
                    <p style="line-height: 1.5;">
                      ♂ (1) Males of this group are distinctive from both M. druriellus and M. pallidisignatus in that the labrum is entirely black with no basomedial yellow macula. Also, 
                      M. grindeliae can be separated from the foregoing species in that the antennae reach the pterostigma in repose instead of falling short. Males of M. grindeliae also 
                      have their tergal margins hyaline rather than opaque, largely separating them from any individuals of M. druriellus.</p>

                      <p style="line-height: 1.5;">
                        ♂ (2) Males of this group are related to M. druriellus, but probably more closely so to M. menuachus and M. robustior. M. grindeliae, just like in group one, 
                        are easily separated from those of M. druriellus by the hyaline tergal margins and the longer first flagellar segment with the minimum length measure one-third 
                        of the second segment’s maximum length. In contrast, M. druriellus has opaque brown to reddish brown tergal margins and the first flagellar segment’s minimum 
                        length is approximately one-fourth to one-sixth of the second segment’s maximum length. M. grindelae males are similar to those of M. robustior and M. menuachus 
                        in that the first flagellar segment’s maximum length is more than one-third of the third segment’s minimum length, and the first tergum doesn't have an obvious 
                        apical band of white, dense, hairs that obscure the apical margin medially. However, M. grindeliae can be separated from M. robustior in that the galeae are 
                        shiny and not shagreened as opposed to being dull and densely shagreened. Males can also be separated from M. menuachus in that the labrum and the bases of the 
                        mandibles have no pale maculations and the mesoscutal and scutellar hairs are abundantly dark medially. In contrast, the labrum and bases of the mandibles are 
                        yellow in M. menuachus and the mesoscutal and scutellar hairs aren’t dark medially.

                      </p>

                     <p style="line-height: 1.5;">
                    ♀ The females of M. grindeliae can resemble both M. druriellus and M. pallidisignatus, but more so the latter due to the pale hairs anterior to the dark mesoscutal 
                    patch. Females can also, to an extent, somewhat resemble those of M. microstictus although less strongly. M. grindeliae can be separated from those of M. druriellus 
                    by the distal pale band of the third tergum that reaches the apex of the tergum laterally as opposed to being largely separated from the apical margin and by the 
                    pale hairs anterior to the mesoscutal dark patch. Females can be separated from those of M. pallidisignatus by the impunctate, or essentially so, interband zone of 
                    T2 that bears erect to suberect dark hairs and the hairs on the inner surfaces of the hind basitarsi that are black to dark reddish brown. As stated above, although 
                    not strongly related to this species, M. grindeliae can bear a resemblance to M. microstictus due to shared vesistural coloration, but differ as follows: the underside 
                    of flagellar segments 3-10 are rufescent, and very noticeably so on the distal most three or four segments; the distal pale band of the second tergum usually isn’t 
                    medially interrupted; and the hairs on the inner surfaces of the hind basitarsi are dark brown to reddish brown.

Although its name suggests oligolecty on the genus of flowers Grindelia, M. grindeliae seems to instead favor Chrysopsis and Ratibida, the two combined accounting for over 
half of the current floral data records. Out of the 271 M. grindeliae records with annotations of which flower it was collected atop, Chrysopsis ranked number one with a total 
of 86 collections and Ratibida ranked number two with a total of 62 collections. This renders Chrysopsis to be favored 31.73% of the time and Ratibida 22.87% of the time by M. 
grindeliae. The remainder of the floral associations seem to show no other notable abundances, suggesting that these two genera are of high importance to M. grindeliae.

                    Melissodes lupinus is an extremely common Oregonian species widespread across the entire state. Males seem to be most closely allied with those of M. 
                    glenwoodensis due to the shared antennal structure, but are distinctive in the sculpturing of the galeae, and the apical areas of the second and third 
                    terga bearing suberect hairs. Females on the other hand aren’t directly allied with any single other species and are distinct in the short truncated 
                    penultimate flagellar segment. The characters listed for both sexes, render M. lupinus as one of the most distinctive and easily identified Melissodes 
                    in Oregon under close examination. Given its range-wide abundance, it's no surprise that this species ranks high within the Oregonian commonality chart. 
                    Even with this taken into account, Eumelissodes in general tend to be more common than Callimelissodes, but unexpectedly, it seems that M. lupinus 
                    ranks number 1 with a total of 374 publicly available records, surpassing M. microstictus (the most common Oregonian Eumelissodes) by over 170 records. 
                    This, paired with its morphology, render M. lupinus one of the most notable, and somewhat outlying species in Oregon. Although the name suggests 
                    otherwise, this species has shown an overwhelming preference towards plants in the family Asteraceae rather than Fabaceae (the family in which lupin 
                    resides). M. lupinus seems to be active from March to October with peak activity occurring in June, July, and August.

                    <p style="line-height: 1.5;">
                    ♂ Paler vestiture with a few darker hairs on the dorsum of the thorax and vertex of the head. The mandibular bases, clypeus, and labrum, are yellow 
                    without a darkened labral margin. The eyes are bluish gray to gray, and on rare occasions, greenish blue and the underside flagellar segments 2-11 are 
                    red to yellow (these segments are dark brown on top). The wing veins are black to brown and terga 2-5 are sometimes yellow hyaline apically, but 
                    usually opaque brown. The first flagellar segment’s minimum length is less than one-fifth of the second segment’s maximum length, and segments 5-9 
                    (sometimes also on 10, never on 11) have shiny, shallow, longitudinal dorsolateral depressions. The length of the penultimate segments is more than 
                    twice its width and the ultimate segment’s length is more than three times its width. The fourth sternum has a wide hyaline flap that is medially 
                    shallowly emarginate. The fifth and third sterna are noticeably apically convex and the galeae are coarsely shagreened above. The apical areas of the 
                    second and third terga have suberect hairs. The first tergum’s basal fourth-fifths bears long pale ochraceous hairs, and the apical area of this same 
                    tergum has suberect, simple, usually pale brown (sometimes ochraceous), short hairs that almost reach the apical margin. The overall vestiture of the 
                    second tergum is pale ochraceous to white. The basal pubescent band of the second tergum is white, as is the distal pale band. However, the distal 
                    pale band is medially interrupted. The apical area of the second tergum bears simple, suberect, often pale ochraceous (sometimes brown) hairs. The 
                    third and fourth terga are similar to that of the second, apart from the distal bands being uninterrupted, the basal tomentum being brown, and the 
                    apical hairs being largely brown (minimally medially and sometimes more). The fifth tergum is similar to that of the fourth, except the distal band 
                    often reaches the apex across the entire tergum and the sixth and seventh terga are entirely covered in pale brown to ochraceous hairs.

                    <br><br>
                    ♀ Generally a pale bee with a dark patch of mesoscutal hairs and dark hairs on the vertex. The eyes are often gray to bluish-gray and the wing veins 
                    are dark brown. The underside of F3-F10, and usually the apical area of F2 are yellow to reddish beneath and the ultimate flagellar segment is 
                    short, around as long as it is wide and approximately equal to the length of the penultimate segment, as well as truncated (almost creating a 
                    square edged appearance). The scopal hairs are highly branched, having more than three branches on either side of each rachis, mostly ochraceous 
                    to white, and, on the posterior area of the tibial apices, a few to several scopal hairs are somewhat sinuous and appressed. The first tergum has 
                    long basal and lateral hairs that are pale ochraceous. The basal area of the second tergum has long pale ochraceous hairs while the interband 
                    zone has suberect comparably simple, short, dark hairs that are dark ochraceous to brown. The distal pale pubescent band of the second tergum is 
                    wide, often becomes medially interrupted, arched, and laterally reaches, or almost reaches, the apes of the tergum. The apical area of the second 
                    tergum is narrowly glabrous marginally, but anterior to this margin, bears suberect to appressed, simple, ochraceous to brown hairs. The third tergum, 
                    is similar to that of the second, apart from the wider uninterrupted distal band that laterally reaches that apex of the tergum, and the interband 
                    zone, which bears appressed, sparse, pale pubescence. The pale ochraceous band on the fourth tergum is wide, positioned apically, and, at times, has 
                    some pale simple hairs near the medial area of the apical margin. The fifth and sixth terga are covered in dark brown hairs apart from the lateral 
                    tufts, which are pale ochraceous.

                      Given thet the structure of the ultimate segment of female M. lupinus is shared by no other species within the genus, a comparison is unnecessary. However, 
                      males can strongly resemble those of M. glenwoodensis due to both species having longitudinal depressions on the outer surfaces of F5-F9 (and sometimes 
                      F10, but never F11) and the first flagellar segment’s minimum length less than, or equal to, one-fourth of the second segment’s maximum length.</p>

                      ♂ Males of M. lupinus can be separated from those of M. glenwoodensis by the apical areas of the second and third terga, which have suberect hairs; and by 
                      the galeae, which are often dull due to dense shagreening. In contrast, the apical areas of the second and third terga of M. glenwoodensis are glabrous as 
                      well as impunctate and the galeae are either shiny or dull due to shagreening.</p>

While its name seems to suggest that it specializes on lupin (Lupinus), M. lupinus seems to be an oligolege of Asteraceae instead. Although it has been found 
atop 16 other families, the numbers of specimens collected atop these are minute in comparison to those collected atop Asteraceae, and are therefore likely 
collecting only nectar instead of pollen, supporting the assumption of oligolecty of Asteraceae (Laberge, 1961). According to the records from Laberge (1961), 
out of the 787 M. lupinus with floral accounts, 659 of them were collected from Asteraceae. This renders Asteraceae to be favored 83.73% of the time by M. lupinus.

                   Males are distinct in that F4-F10 have longitudinal depressions (if a depression is present on the third segment, it’s not well defined); the length of 
                   the penultimate flagellar segment is longer than two times its width; the apical areas of the second and third terga are glabrous and the galeae are 
                   often shagreened dorsally; the eyes are often yellow-green to green;  and the interband zone of the third tergum (usually the second one as well) have 
                   their punctures that are mostly separated by one puncture diameter, with many that are separated by two to three puncture diameters. Females are distinctive 
                   in that the first tergum’s crowded basal punctures are restricted to, and do not surpass the, basal third or less medially; punctures past the medial 
                   one-third of the first tergum are mostly separated by more than two puncture diameters (not crowded); the galeae are moderately shiny above, delicately 
                   reticularly shagreened, but not densely tessellate; the hairs on the inner surfaces of the hind basitarsi are red to yellow and the scopal hairs are pale 
                   ochraceous to white; the fifth and sixth terga have golden to pale brown medial hairs and large white lateral tufts of hairs; the punctures on the mesoscutum 
                   medial to the parapsidal lines are irregularly sized (mostly smaller than those of the mesepisterna and scutellum), and separated by more than one-half, 
                   with many by more than two, puncture diameters. In both sexes, the apical areas of the terga (apart from the first and last two) are glabrous and very shiny, 
                   likely the character from which the species name “lustrus” (originally lustra) was derived. A similar pattern to that of the M. druriellus group 
                   (M. druriellus, M. pallidisignatus, and M. grindeliae) is mirrored within the M. compositus group (the group in which M. lustrus resides). That is, all 
                   species range-wide within these groups all occur, or likely occur, in Oregon and share very similar characteristics. This suggests that a common ancestor 
                   may be shared amongst the M. compositus group, from which the current-day species diverged. M. lustrus has been found across most of Oregon, and undoubtedly 
                   occurs across the entire state (Fig. ??). This species was originally thought to be active between the months of August and November (Laberge, 1961), but 
                   newer data suggests that activity starts around July (a few observations have been made in May and March, but these may not reflect the true phenological 
                   cycle) with peak activity occurring in August and September.

                    ♂ Like most males, generally a pale bee with yellow-brown hyaline apical tergal margins. The mandibular bases, clypeus, and labrum are yellow, with the 
                    labrum’s apical margin not darkened. The eyes are greenish yellow and the wing veins are black to brown. The underside flagellar segments 2-11are red to 
                    yellow (these segments are dark brown on top), the first flagellar segment’s minimum length is one-third to one-fourth of the second segment’s maximum 
                    length, and segments 4-10 (sometimes also on 11 but poorly defined on 3 if at all present) have shiny, shallow, longitudinal dorsolateral depressions. The 
                    length of the penultimate segments is more than twice, but less than three times, its width and the ultimate segment’s length is approximately three times 
                    its width. The fourth sternum is medially broad and shallowly emarginate, or evenly convex across the sterna, and the fifth and third sterna are noticeably 
                    apically convex. The apical areas of the second and third terga are glabrous and the galeae are often shagreened dorsally. The interband zone of the third 
                    tergum, and usually the second as well, have their punctures mostly separated by one puncture diameter, and several that are separated by 2 to 3 puncture 
                    diameters. The head hairs are most ochraceous to cinereous, apart from the vertex, which bear brighter (sometimes faintly rufescent) hairs. The thoracic 
                    hairs are also mostly ochraceous to cinereous apart from the dorsal areas, which bear brighter (sometimes faintly rufescent) hairs. The tergal hairs are 
                    mostly pale ochraceous to white, with the second, third, and fourth terga having glabrous apical areas; the fifth tergum, which reaches the apex across 
                    the entire tergum; and the sixth and seventh terga, which have some pale brown to dark ochraceous hairs, predominantly medially and basally.


                    <br><br>
                   ♀ Genearlly a pale ochraceous bee with entirely opaque tergal margins. The eyes are green to greenish yellow and the wing veins are dark brown. The 
                   underside of F3-F10, and usually the apical area of F2 are yellow to reddish beneath and the galeae are moderately shiny to shiny, reticularly shagreened 
                   in the apical half or more, and have largely spaced punctures with straight hairs arising from them (no dense tessellation) The scopal hairs are highly 
                   branched, having more than three branches on either side of each rachis and white to pale ochraceous. The first tergum’s crowded basal punctures are 
                   restricted to, and do not surpass, the basal third or less medially. If areas past the medial one-third of the first tergum have punctures, then they 
                   are mostly separated by more than two puncture diameters. The hairs on the inner surfaces of the hind basitarsi are red to yellow and the fifth and sixth 
                   terga have golden to pale brown medial hairs as well as large white lateral tufts of hairs. The punctures on the mesoscutum medial to the parapsidal 
                   lines are irregularly sized (mostly smaller than those of the mesepisterna and scutellum), and separated by more than one-half, with many by more than two, 
                   puncture diameters. The first tergum has ochraceous basal hairs, but the apical area is glabrous. The second tergum’s basal area has white to pale 
                   ochraceous pubescence, and the distal band is instead reduced to lateral short, oblique, pale fasciae that reaches, or almost reaches, the apical margin 
                   at extreme lateral areas. The basal band is connected to this lateral fasciae by pale pubescence. The apical area of the second tergum is glabrous, but 
                   the interband zone has suberect to appressed, simple, pale brown, tiny, scattered hairs. The third tergum is similar to that of the second, except the 
                   basal hairs are brown, the distal band is usually complete with no medial interruption, the apical area is shorter (approximately one-half of the medial 
                   area of the distal band), and the interband zone is instead covered in pale, diffused, appressed, hairs. The fourth tergum is similar to that of the 
                   third, except the distal band reaches the apex across the entire tergum and is always complete.

                    <p style="line-height: 1.5;">
                      M. lustrus is interesting in that the females are similar to two species, those being M. compositus and M. glenwoodensis, but males are only related 
                      to one, M. compositus. M. lustrus females are allied with these species in that the crowded basal punctures of T1 do not surpass the basal one-third 
                      medially, but seem to be most closely related to the former. Males on the other hand only resemble those of M. compositus due to F4-F10 have depressions, 
                      the length of the penultimate flagellar segment is longer than two times its width, and the apical areas of T2 and T3 are glabrous. Surprisingly given 
                      the female clade that is formed, males are highly distinct from those of M. glenwoodensis in the matter of their flagellar depressions.
</p>
                    <p style="line-height: 1.5;">
                      ♂ Males can be separated from those of M. compositus by the interband zone of the third tergum, and usually the second as well, which 
                      have punctures that are mostly separated by one puncture diameter (several that are separated by 2 to 3 puncture diameters) and the eyes, 
                      which are often yellowish green to green. Although females are similar to M. glenwoodensis, males differ in that flagellar segments 4-11 have 
                      longitudinal depressions, whereas in M. glenwoodensis, only F5-F9 (occasionally F10, but never F4 or F11) have depressions. For this reason, 
                      M. glenwoodensis is strangely more allied with M. lupinus due to the antennal structure.

<p style="line-height: 1.5;">
                      ♀ Females of M. lustrus can be separated from those of M. glenwoodensis by the red to yellow hairs on the inner surfaces of the hind 
                      basitarsi, and the fifth and sixth terga having golden to pale brown medial hairs as well as large white lateral tufts of hairs. In 
                      contrast, M. glenwoodensis have black to dark reddish brown hairs on the inner surfaces of the hind bastitarsi and the fifth and sixth 
                      terga have black to dark brown hairs or no white lateral tufts. However, M. compositus shares these same traits with M. lustrus, and is 
                      instead separated by tergal sculpturing. M. lustrus is separated from those of M. compositus in that the mesoscutal punctures medial to 
                      the parapsidal lines are irregularly sized (mostly smaller than those of the mesepisterna and scutellum), and separated by more than one-half, 
                      with many by more than two, puncture diameters. In contrast, M. compositus has its mesoscutal punctures medial to the parapsidal lines often 
                      and/or mostly larger than those of the mesepisterna or scutellum, and mostly separated by less than, or equal to, one-half of a puncture diameter.

According to Laberge (1961) M. lustrus is a known oligolege of Asteraceae, depending on its plants for pollen, but especially so for the genera of Gutierrezia (snakeweed). Along 
with this, M. lustrus also seems to partially rely on plants from the genera Chrysothamnus (rabbitbrush) and Isocoma (goldenbrush), but to a lesser extent. From a total of 63 
specimens with floral data attached, 61 were collected atop Asteraceae, hence the oligolecty. However, it seems as though these 61 specimens were collected across 44 collection 
events, 17 events of which all specimens were collected atop Gutierrezia. Assuming a similar amount of individuals were collected across all collection events, approximately 24 
specimens were found atop species of Gutierrezia, rendering this genus to be favored by M. lustrus 39.34% of the time. For this estimation to be somewhat accurate, an assumption 
of individuals per collection events must be made, and as this isn’t specified in Laberge (1961), the percentage is therefore speculatory.

                  Melissodes lutulentus, the Muddy longhorn bee, is a rarer Melissodes in Oregon, with a total of 9 publicly available state records, placing this species 
                  as the eighth rarest Oregonian Melissodes. M. lutulentus seems to be allied with M. subagilis as well as M. pullatellus, but more so the former than the 
                  latter. Males are distinctive in that the first flagellar segment’s minimum length is usually equivalent to one-fifth to one-eighth the second segment’s 
                  maximum length; the clypeus is entirely light excluding the dark spots denoting the tentorial depressions or the anterior notches and margin; the labrum 
                  usually has a mediobasal cream-colored macula, although not always; the mandibular bases have no yellow macula; the punctures on the interband zone of 
                  the second tergum are large and mostly separated by two puncture diameters or less (each puncture is notably wider than the bases of the hairs that arise 
                  from them); the interband zones of the third and fourth terga have large, deep, round punctures that are mostly separated by 1 puncture diameter; the first 
                  tergum’s apical hairs are appressed, white, dense, plumose, and short creating a distinct band that reaches the apex across the entire tergum (only fully 
                  obscuring the apical areas laterally); the second tergum’s distal pale pubescent band is at least as wide, and usually wider, than the apical area (sometimes 
                  obscures the entire apical area). Females are distinctive in that the apical area of the third tergum is narrower than the second tergum’s distal pale band 
                  (and one-third of the width of the third tergum’s pale band or less); the apical tergal areas are opaque, or translucent dark brown (not hyaline); the distal 
                  pale band of the second tergum usually isn’t medially interrupted; the underside of most of the flagellum is dark red; the interband zone of the second 
                  tergum bears pale subappressed hairs and usually dark brown, appressed to subappressed, spine-like hairs. This species has been found across the majority of 
                  Oregon, and although its westward most Oregonian observation occurred near Klamath Falls, it seems as though M. lutulentus inhabits somewhat coastal/bay 
                  areas in California, such as Antioch, suggesting it may be present throughout the entirety of the state. This species was historically believed to be active 
                  from May to October with peak activity occurring in July and August, and newer data suggest a similar sentiment, but peak activity seems to occur more so in 
                  August than July.

                    ♂ Very pale in vestiture, cinereous to almost white. The eyes are often blue to greenish blue, and sometimes they can be gray to yellowish gray. 
                    The clypeus is yellow besides for the darkened tentorial depressions and the testaceous apical margin and the labrum usually has a mediobasal cream-colored 
                    macula, although not always. The wing veins are dark brown or black to red and the underside of the flagellar segments 2-11, which are red to yellow 
                    (F1 entirely dark brown). The terga are colorless to faintly yellow hyaline in the apical areas and the clypeus is flat without a large bulge or 
                    concavity. The first flagellar segment’s minimum length is usually equivalent to one-fifth to one-eighth the second segment’s maximum length. The 
                    minimum length of the first flagellar segment (smaller side of F1) is often more than half the maximum length (longer side of F1). The length of the 
                    penultimate flagellar segment is longer than three times its width. The flagellum reaches the pterostigma when in repose. The punctures on the interband 
                    zone of the second tergum are larger and mostly separated by two puncture diameters or less; each puncture is notably wider than the bases of the hairs 
                    that arise from them. The interband zones of the third and fourth terga have large, deep, round punctures that are mostly separated by 1 puncture diameter. 
                    The head hairs are often entirely cinereous to white. The thoracic hairs are mostly cinereous to white apart from the mesoscutum, which has its 
                    posteromedial area abundantly covered in long brown hairs, and the scutellum, which has long brown medial hairs. The setal description is as follows: 
                    the first tergum’s apical hairs are appressed, white, dense, plumose, and short. This creates a distinct band that reaches the apex across the entire 
                    tergum, but only obscures the apical area laterally. The second tergum’s distal pale pubescent band is at least as wide, and usually wider, than the 
                    apical area (often reaching the apical margin laterally and sometimes across the entire tergum). The third, fourth, and fifth terga are similar to that 
                    of the second, except the pubescent bands become closer to the apical margin with each subsequent tergum until the band reaches the apex across the apex 
                    across the entire tergum on T5. The sixth and seventh terga are completely covered in white to dark ochraceous hairs. 

                    <br><br>
                  ♀ Generally pale bee with dark hairs on the dorsum of the thorax, much less ochraceous than those of M. agilis. The eyes are often blue, but sometimes they 
                  are gray or greenish blue and the mandibles are usually rufescent. The wing veins are usually reddish brown to black, and often dark red. The underside of 
                  flagellar segments 3-10, and usually the second in the apical one-third are red to yellow (dark brown on top) and the apical one-third of first tergum, 
                  which is usually rufescent. The interband zone of the second tergum has dark brown, appressed to subappressed, spine-like hairs. The galeae are dull due 
                  to shagreening and the hairs on the inner surfaces of the hind basitarsi are dark. The apical areas of the second, third, and fourth terga are piceous 
                  (mostly opaque, or if slightly hyaline, then dark brown hyaline). The apical area of the third tergum is narrower than the second tergum’s distal pale 
                  band (and one-third of the width of the third tergum’s pale band or less). The first tergum’s basal area bears pale ochraceous hairs, but in the apical 
                  areas, the tergum is glabrous. The basal pale pubescent band of the second tergum is white. The interband zone of the second tergum bears short, 
                  completely to primarily ochraceous, suberect to subappressed hairs. The distal pale pubescent band of the second tergum is white to pale ochraceous, 
                  often uninterrupted medially, medially wider than that of the apical area, often reaches the apex of the tergum laterally, and composed of short, closely 
                  spaced, appressed, plumose hairs (these hairs present across the apical area of the band as well). The third tergum is similar to that of the second, 
                  except the distal pale pubescent band is around three times the width of the medial portion of the apical area or more, and the basal tomentum is brown. 
                  The fourth tergum’s distal pale pubescent band is pale ochraceous to white, complete, and reaches the apex across the entire tergum. The fifth tergum 
                  either bears, or does not bear long wide lateral tufts of pale hairs and the sixth tergum is medially orange-ish brown to brown either with or without 
                  pale tufts.

                    <p style="line-height: 1.5;">
                     Both sexes of M. lutulentus are most similar to M. subagilis, but females are also very weakly allied with M. pullatellus. 
                     This is due to a similar sculpturing shared between the species, but females do not closely resemble those of M. pullatellus 
                     due to the differing vestiture (M. pullatellus is almost entirely black), and therefore a subsequent comparison seems 
                     unnecessary. Females can also, to an extent, resemble those of the M. druriellus group (M. druriellus, M. pallidisignatus, 
                     and M. grindeliae) as well as M. microstictus as the vestiture is similar, but to a lesser extent than M. subagilis. Males 
                     are somewhat similar to the M. semilupinus group (M. bimatris and M. semilupinus) due to the apical band of hairs on T1, but 
                     slightly differ in this band’s structure.
</p>
                    <p style="line-height: 1.5;">
                     ♂ Males of M. lutulentus can be separated from those of M. subagilis by the first tergum’s apical hairs, which are appressed, white, 
                     dense, plumose, and short creating a distinct band that reaches the apex across the entire tergum (only obscures the lateral areas); 
                     the mesoscutum and scutellum usually have dark hairs (not always); and the second tergum’s distal pale pubescent band, which is at 
                     least as wide, and usually wider, than the apical area. In contrast, the first tergum’s apical hairs of M. subagilis are medially 
                     sparse and/or minutely barbed (only dense and plumose laterally), the dorsal thoracic hairs are entirely light, and the second tergum’s 
                     distal pale pubescent band is usually narrower than the apical area. The males can also somewhat resemble those of M. bimatris and M. 
                     semilupinus, but can be easily separated by the apical band on the first tergum not medially obscuring the apical margin.

</p>

<p style="line-height: 1.5;">
                     ♀ Given their strong aliance, M. lutulentus females will initially be compared to those of M. subagilis, then subsequent 
                     comparisons of weaker resemblance will follow. M. lutulentus can be identified from those of M. subagilis by the large dark 
                     mesoscutal patch that's minimally larger than the scutellar dark patch, and the overall pale hairs taking on a white color. 
                     In contrast, the mesoscutum of M. subagilis usually doesn’t have a dark patch of hairs, but if it does, then it’s smaller 
                     than that of the scutellum’s dark patch, and the pale hairs are mostly ochraceous to yellow (prominently so on the mesoscutum). 
                     M. lutulentus can also resemble those of M. grindeliae due to similar vestiture, but differ in the pale appressed to 
                     subappressed hairs of the interband zone of T2 and the more abundant punctures on the  interband zone of T2. In contrast, 
                     the interband zone of the second tergum of M. grindeliae is impuncate or essentially so and has erect to suberect dark hairs. 
                     However, M. lutulentus often has dark brown appressed to subappressed, spine-like hairs on the interband zone mixed with the 
                     pale hairs, but M. grindeliae has no pale hairs. Females can also resemble M. pallidisignatus, but differ in the smaller size 
                     (the length of the forewing including the tegulae is less than 9 mm.). Lastly, M. lutulentus can bear a resemblance, though 
                     not very strongly, to M. druriellus, but can quickly be separated by the non-contrasting sculpturing of the second tergum’s 
                     interband zone and apical area.

Very little is known in regards to the flower records of M. lutulentus. Laberge (1961) states the M. lutulentus is an Asteraceae oligolege, preferring Chrysothamnus, Solidago, and Grindelia, but that seems to be the extent of what is currently known.

                  Melissodes menuachus, the Goldenrod longhorn bee, is interesting as the females are very closely allied with M. semilupinus, and males seem to be allied 
                  with those of M. semilupinus as well, but lack the distinctive character of the apical band on the first tergum. Males fall into two separate groups 
                  based on their morphology, one where the first flagellar segment’s maximum length is more than one-third of the third segment’s minimum length, and the 
                  other where the first flagellar segment’s maximum length is less than, or equal to, one-third of the third segment’s minimum length. These will be known 
                  as group one (more than one-third), and group two (equal to, or less than, one-third); this can be seen at couplet 23 of the male key. Group one of the 
                  males are distinctive in that the first flagellar segment’s maximum length is more than one-third of the third segment’s minimum length; the first tergum 
                  has a band across its apical margin, but does not obscure the apical area medially; the galeae are shiny with no shagreening; the labrum and mandibular 
                  bases are yellow and the mesoscutal and scutellar hairs are not medially dark. Group two of the males are distinctive in that the first flagellar segment’s 
                  maximum length is less than, or equal to, one-third of the third segment’s minimum length; the clypeus is entirely light excluding the dark spots denoting 
                  the tentorial depressions or the anterior notches and margin; the mandibular bases have a yellow macula and the labrum has a large mediobasal pale macula 
                  (at least equal to, and usually larger than, one-third of the labrum); the galeae are shiny above with no shagreening, except for the tips; the first 
                  flagellar segment’s maximum length is equal to, or almost equal to, one-third of the third segment’s maximum length, and the minimum length of the first 
                  flagellar segment is notably longer than the pedicel’s length on the same side. Females do not share the same variation as the males, and are distinct in 
                  that the length of the second flagellar segment is faintly, but notably longer than its width; the hairs on the inner surfaces of the hind basitarsi are 
                  dark brown to brown; the fifth and sixth terga have pale ochraceous to white lateral tufts of hairs; the mesepisterna have no dark hairs. This species has 
                  a total of six state-wide records, placing it the seventh rarest in Oregon, that mostly occur in the Eastern areas of this region (Fig. ??). However, even 
                  though its westward most Oregonian observation was recorded near Pendleton, range-wide data show that M. menuachus has a presence in coastal Californian 
                  areas, implying that it may occur across the entire state. This species has been historically known to be active between July and October with peak activity 
                  occurring in August and September (Laberge, 1961), and new data seem to reflect this (Fig. ??).

                    <p style="line-height: 1.5;">
                    ♂ Generally a vey pale bee, often with yellowish hairs on the distal two most terga. The eyes are greenish gray to yellowish gray and the clypeus is 
                    yellow. The labrum is mostly white except for the apical margin, which is narrowly brown and the bases of the mandibles are yellow. The wing veins are 
                    pale red to yellow and flagellar segments 2-10 are red to yellow on the underside and dark red to brown on top (first segment usually completely dark). 
                    The apices of the terga are colorless to yellow hyaline and the clypeus protrudes beyond the eye by about half the width of an eye in profile view. 
                    The first flagellar segment’s minimum length is about two-thirds of its maximum length, and noticeably longer than the pedicle on the same side. The 
                    penultimate segment is about three times as long (maximum) as it is wide (minimum). None of the flagellar segments have longitudinal lateral depressions. 
                    The first flagellar segment’s maximum length can be more than, less than, or equal to one-third of the third segment’s minimum length, and the first flagellar 
                    segment’s minimum length is about one-fifth or somewhat less than the maximum length of the second segment. The galeae are shiny with no shagreening and the 
                    mesoscutal and scutellar hairs are not dark medially. The hairs on both the head and the thorax are white to pale ochraceous, but on the vertex of the head 
                    and the dorsal area of the thorax, the hairs become a brighter ochraceous. The first tergum has long basal white to ochraceous hairs and long appressed to 
                    subappressed apical pale hairs that reach the apex across the tergum but don’t obscure the apical portion medially; sometimes not obscuring the apical 
                    margin more than medially. The second tergum has white basal pubescence and pale suberect, bristle-like hairs on the interband zone. The distal pubescent 
                    band of the second tergum is anteriorly separated from the apex of the tergum by about one-half to one times the length of the medial area of the pale 
                    band and is not interrupted medially. Terga 3-5 are similar to that of the second tergum except for the interband zones, which in addition to the bristle-like 
                    hairs there are also delicate, sparse, white, appressed pubescence. Also, the distal bands of terga 3-5 become closer to the apical margin with each tergum.

                  ♀ Very pale bee, especially for those of female Melissodes, with incredibly long, often pale yellow, sometimes pale ochraceous scopae. The eyes are greenish 
                  blue to bluish gray and the apical margin of the clypeus is often rufescent. The wing veins are reddish brown to red and the underside of flagellar segments 
                  3-10 are rufescent. The apical areas of terga 2-4 are sometimes rufescent and the galeae are shiny. The fifth and sixth terga have pale ochraceous to white 
                  lateral tufts of hairs. The mesepisterna have no dark hairs. The length of the second flagellar segment is faintly, but notably longer than its width and the 
                  hairs on the inner surfaces of the hind basitarsi are are dark brown to brown. The first tergum’s basal area has long, pale, ochraceous hairs that reach the 
                  apical margin at extreme lateral areas but not medially. The apical area of the first tergum is glabrous. The second tergum’s white basal pubescence laterally 
                  connects to the distal pale band. The interband zone of the second tergum has rather simple, subappressed, sparse pale hairs. The distal pale pubescent band 
                  is two times the length of the apical glabrous area laterally, and medially, the band is narrowed and notched measuring only half the length of the apical 
                  glabrous area. The third tergum is similar to that of the second, except the basal tomentum is dark brown and the distal pale band is separated from the apical 
                  margin due to a narrow line/zone of rather simple, suberect, pale hairs. The fourth tergum is similar to that of the third, but lacks the narrow line/zone of 
                  simple, suberect, pale hairs. The fifth and sixth terga are entirely covered in brown hairs excluding the white lateral tufts.

                    <p style="line-height: 1.5;">
                      Females of M. menuachus are very similar to those of M. semilupinus in the length of the second flagellar segment. Males are similar to M. semilupinus as 
                      well, but starkly differs in the vestiture of the first tergum. Other than M. semilupinus, M. menuachus does not seem to directly resemble any other species 
                      in Oregon (M. menuachus is related to M. submenuachus, but this species doesn't reside in Oregon) apart from superficial vestiture similarities, which will 
                      be treated below.

</p>
                    <p style="line-height: 1.5;">
                      ♂ Males are somewhat allied with M. semilupinus, be it less than the females, and differ largely in that the first tergum’s apical margin isn’t obscured 
                      by a dense band of pubescence. Due to similar vestiture and integumental coloration, M. menuachus can also resemble M. agilis in that they both have 
                      hyaline tergal margins, mandibular macula, pale labrums, very similar to almost identical vestiture (when compared to a lighter male of M. agilis), 
                      and similar antennal coloration. However, the two differ greatly in the length of the first flagellar segment and the galeal sculpture. M. menuachus 
                      has shiny, unshagreened to very little shagreened galeae and the first flagellar segment’s minimum length is about one-fifth or somewhat less than the 
                      maximum length of the second segment. Whereas in M. agilis, the galeae are densely shagreened and the minimum length of the first flagellar segments is 
                      about one-sixth to one-fifth of the second segment’s maximum length.


<p style="line-height: 1.5;">
                     ♀ Females are really only similar to one species, that is M. semilupinus, due to the length of the second flagellar segment being faintly, but 
                     notably longer than its width (these are the only two species in Oregon with this characteristic). M. menuachus can be separated from those of M. 
                     semilupinus by the fifth and sixth terga, which have pale ochraceous to white lateral tufts of hairs; and the mesepisterna, which have no dark hairs. 
                     In contrast, \the fifth and sixth terga of M. semilupinus do not have pale ochraceous to white lateral tufts of hairs; and the mesepisternal hairs are 
                     black to dark brown on the lower-lateral areas. As no other species share the antennal structure in Oregon, this renders M. menuachus quite distinct, 
                     and further comparisons based on similar vestiture seem unnecessary.

                    <p style="line-height: 1.5;">
M. menuachus is a known oligolege of plants from the family Asteraceae, and seem to specifically prefer Grindeliae and Solidago 
(Laberge, 1961). Of the 153 M. menuachus collected with floral data attached, 69 have been collected atop species from the genus 
Grindelia, and 23 have been collected from Solidago; the two combined comprising over 60% of the total flower records. This renders 
Grindeliae to be favored 45.09% of the time, and Solidago 15.03% of the time, by M. menuachus. The remaining flowers do not show any 
specific outlying values, suggesting that the foregoing genera are of great importance to M. menuachus, hence the high percentages.

                 Melissodes metenuus seems to be most closely allied with M. plumosus in both sexes, but the males seem to resemble one another much more than the 
                 females. Similarly to those of M. druriellus, M. metenuus females range widely in setal colorations, but no specific geographical variations have 
                 been discovered in regards to their vestiture. As it's unknown what morphs occur in Oregon, general descriptions of the two extremes (darkest and 
                 lightest) will be given, along with a list of the features and how they gradient between the extremes. Males are distinctive in that the length of 
                 the penultimate flagellar segment is longer than two times its width; the apical areas of the second and third terga have simple, erect to suberect 
                 hairs; F4-F10 have lateral depressions, and the third flagellar segment also usually has a well defined ventrolateral depression; the galeae are 
                 dorsally shiny and unshagreened, or if shagreened, then delicately so on less than, or equal to, the apical half; sterna 2-4 are medially shiny and 
                 delicately reticularly shagreened; the clypeus is coarsely punctate basally. Females are distinctive in that the scopae are mostly white to pale 
                 yellow; the lateral areas of the mesepisterna bear dark hairs; the crowded basal punctures of the first tergum do not surpass the basal one-half; 
                 the head hairs are entirely, or almost entirely, dark brown to black; the hairs on the inner surfaces of the hind bastitarsi and often the tibiae 
                 are dark reddish brown to black; the galeae are shiny to moderately shiny above with no, or very little, faint shagreening. This species has a total 
                 of 84 state records, placing it the third most common Oregonian Melissodes, outpacing M. robustior by 9 observations. M. metenuus has been found across 
                 the entirety of Oregon, with most observations occurring West of bend, but these may be simply due to sampling biases. In the literature, this species 
                 has been reported to show activity between June and September, with peak activity occurring in July and August, and current data suggest the same 
                 pattern (Fig. ??).

                    <p style="line-height: 1.5;">
                   ♂ Generally a paler bee with its tergal rims somtimes yellow hyaline apically, but usually opaque brown. The mandibular bases and labrum 
                   (the labrum having its margin not darkened are yellow). The clypeaus is a light yellowish orange and the eyes are greenish blue to greenish gray. 
                   The underside flagellar segments 2-11 are red to yellow (these segments are dark brown on top) and the wing veins are black to brown. The first 
                   flagellar segment’s minimum length is less than, or equal to, one-fifth of the second segment’s maximum length, and segments 3-10 (often on the 
                   basal portion of 11 as well) have shiny, shallow, longitudinal dorsolateral depressions. TThe length of the penultimate flagellar segment is 
                   longer than two times its width and the ultimate segment’s length is more than three times its width. The fourth sternum has a wide hyaline flap 
                   that is not medially shallowly emarginate (or if emarginate, then incredibly shallowly), and the fifth and third sterna are noticeably apically 
                   convex. The galeae are dorsally shiny and unshagreened, or if shagreened, then delicately so and only on less than, or equal to, the apical half. 
                   Sterna 2-4 are medially shiny and are delicately reticularly shagreened. The clypeus is coarsely punctate basally. The apical areas of the second 
                   and third terga have simple, erect to suberect hairs. The first tergum’s basal fourth-fifths bears long pale ochraceous hairs, and the apical 
                   area of the tergum has suberect, simple, usually dark brown, short, sparse hairs that almost reach the apical margin. The overall vestiture of 
                   the second tergum is pale ochraceous to white. The basal pubescent band of the second tergum is white, as is the distal pale band. However, the 
                   distal pale band is medially interrupted. The apical area of the second tergum bears simple, sparse, suberect, often pale dark brown hairs. The 
                   third and fourth terga are similar to that of the second, apart from the distal bands being uninterrupted and the basal tomentum being brown. The 
                   fifth tergum is similar to that of the fourth, except the distal band often reaches the apex across the entire tergum. The sixth and seventh 
                   terga are entirely covered in pale brown to ochraceous hairs. 
                    <br><br>
                ♀ Generally a darker bee, but vestiture coloration can vary widely. However, the head hairs are always dark, an important feature in 
                identification of M. metenuus. The eyes are bluish green to greenish gray and the wing veins are black to dark brown. The underside of F3-F10, 
                and usually the apical area of F2 are yellow to reddish. The galeae are shiny to moderately shiny above with no, or very little, faint 
                shagreening. The hairs on the inner surfaces of the hind bastitarsi and often the tibiae are dark reddish brown to black. The lateral areas 
                of the mesepisterna bear dark hairs and the crowded basal punctures of the first tergum do not surpass the basal one-half. Given that the females 
                are highly variable in vestiture (not binomial as in M. bimatris having a single light and dark form with no intergrades), full descriptions 
                regarding their setae will be given; one for the lightest form, the darkest form, and the steps of integration. The darkest individuals have 
                entirely black hairs, differing at the scopae, which are whitish to pale yellow, the tibiae, which are also whitish to pale yellow; the basitarsi, 
                which are brown to pale yellow; and the outer surfaces of the tibiae, which are apically white. The description for the palest individuals is 
                as follows. The head hairs are entirely black. The thoracic hairs are entirely dark brown to black, differing at the scutellum, which has some 
                pale hairs on its periphery; the mesoscutum, which has some pale ochraceous hairs on the lateral areas and anterior most one-third; the 
                metanotum, which has some pale hair dorsally; the propodeum, which also has some pale hair dorsally; and the top one-third of the lateral 
                mesepisternal surfaces, which have ochraceous hairs. The basal one-half of the first tergum bears mostly dark hairs with a few pale hairs mixed. 
                The second tergum has cinereous, oblique, lateral, fasciae on either side of the tergum rather than a complete band. The fasciae are medially 
                separated from one another minimally by the length of one fascia, and sometimes more. The third tergum has a distal pale band of cinereous pubescence 
                that is separated from the apical margin across the entire tergum. The fourth tergum is similar to that of the third. The fifth and sixth terga 
                are covered entirely in dark hairs with no lateral pale tufts. The scopae are white to pale yellow with some brown hairs near the basitibial 
                plate, as well as on the lateral and apical areas of the basitarsi. The outer surfaces of the fore tibiae and middle tibiae usually bear white 
                hairs near the apex.

                <br><br>
                M. menuachus females range between the two extremes presented. Starting from the darkest form, light hairs appear in these steps: 1) pale fasciae 
                on the third tergum is developed and the dorsal surfaces of the metanotum and propodeum bear their pale hairs; 2) pale hairs develop laterally on 
                the fourth tergum, on the anterior areas of the mesoscutum, and on the periphery of the scutellum; 3) pale hairs develop on the second tergum, 
                the basal areas of the first tergum, and on the upper lateral areas of the mesepisterna.

                   <p style="line-height: 1.5;"> M. metenuus is perhaps most closely allied to those of M. plumosus, but females can resemble a few other Oregonian Melissodes, especially so 
                    in the darkest morph. Males are similar to M. plumosus as they both share the characters of the apical areas of the second and third terga 
                    having simple, erect to suberect hairs; the galeae are often being shiny without shagreening or delicately reticularly shagreened; The third 
                    flagellar segment usually having a well defined ventrolateral depression; the length of the penultimate flagellar segment being longer than 
                    two times its width; and F4-F10 (along with the well defined depression on F3) have longitudinal depressions on the outer surface that are 
                    shallow, narrow, and shiny. Females aren’t necessarily directly related to any other Callimelissodes in Oregon, but rather can resemble a few 
                    darker Eumelissodes such as M. pullatellus, M. bimatris, and sometimes even M. rivalis.

                      ♂ Males of M. metenuus can be separated from those of M. plumosus by the galeae, which are dorsally shiny and unshagreened, or if shagreened, 
                      then delicately so on less than, or equal to, the apical half; sterna 2-4 are medially shiny and are delicately reticularly shagreened; and 
                      the clypeus is coarsely punctate basally. In contrast, males of M. plumosus have galeae that are somewhat dull dorsally due to delicate 
                      distinct shagreening; sterna 2-4, which are only moderately shiny medially due to shagreening; the clypeus, which has small round basal 
                      punctures. Separation of the two species is quite difficult as they are incredibly similar, only distinctly differing in the sculpture of sterna 2-4. 

<p style="line-height: 1.5;">
                 ♀ Whithin their sungenus, females of M. metenuus are somewhat distinct in Oregon given the dark hairs on their heads. However, outside Callimelissodes, 
                 darker forms of M. metenuus can resemble M. pullatellus, and lighter forms can resemble those of M. rivalis. Females can be separated from all other 
                 Oregonian subgenera by the dark hairs on the side of the thorax, and the crowded basal punctures on the first tergum not surpassing the basal one-half, 
                 and often less. Females can be separated from those of M. rivalis in that the inner eye margins noticeably converge near the mandibles, and that the 
                 clypeus protrudes beyond the eye by less than one-half of an eye's width in profile view. In contrast, M. rivalis’ inner margins of the eyes are parallel 
                 to one another, and the clypeus protrudes beyond the eye by one-half to two-thirds of an eye’s width in profile view. Due to the combination of these 
                 two characters, females of M. metenuus are somewhat distinctive in Oregon, much more so than their male counterparts.

A total of 3 flower records are known of M. metenuus, only one of a female visitor. All flower records included in 
this list are from reports in the literature or datasets. Each flower has a parenthesized reference listed after it, 
corresponding to the literary work or dataset in which it was recorded. Currently, M. metenuus has been collected atop 
Cosmos sp. (Laberge, 1961), Eriogonum sp. (Laberge, 1961; listed as “Erigonum,” a possible misspelling), and Melilotus 
officinalis (Laberge, 1961; listed as the historical synonym “Melilotus alba”). With only a single female record (Melilotus 
officinalis), a justifiable statement of preference and/or oligolecty seems unfounded.

               Melissodes microstictus, the small longhorn bee, is, as its vernacular name suggests, a small bee that seems to be very distinctive in Oregon. 
               This species seems to be the most closely related to M. menuachus out of all the other Oregonian Melissodes (be it weakly), but most closely 
               resembles those of M. paululus. Males are distinctive in that the underside of the flagellae are almost completely black, apart from a small 
               ventral pale macula, and have no depressions; the terga are apically hyaline; the first flagellar segment’s maximum length is less than, or 
               equal to, one-third of the third segment’s minimum length; and the clypeus is partially black. The females are distinctive in that the flagellum 
               is almost entirely black to dark reddish brown apart from a few dark red small ventral maculations of F3-F10; the distal pubescent band of the 
               second tergum is narrowly interrupted; the hairs on the inner surfaces of the hind basitarsi are dark; the length of the forewing including the 
               tegulae measures to be 7.0 to 8.5 mm. and the pygidial plate is V-shaped acutely; The apical areas of the second, third, and fourth terga are 
               piceous; the apical area of the third tergum is often mostly obscured due to the distal band which reaches the apex, minimally laterally and often 
               more (apical area always narrower than the second tergum’s distal band); the hairs on the anterior area of the mesoscutum are erect and blunt-tipped, 
               appearing as if they have been cut. This species is the second most common of its genus in Oregon with a total of 202 records widespread across the 
               entire state, falling second only to M. lupinus. This high commonality paired with the distinctive morphological traits renders this species quite 
               notable within Oregon (similar to M. lupinus), making it easily one of the most recognizable species state-wide. M. microstictus has been 
               historically recorded to be active between the months of June and October, with peak activity occurring in July and August (Laberge, 1961), 
               but it seems a few collections suggest that activity can possibly commence as early as April (Fig. ??). However, these records seem to be outliers, 
               and June is suggestive of the most representative month of activity commencement.

                    <p style="line-height: 1.5;">
                 ♂ Somewhat pale bee, but there is a noticeable black to very dark brown patch of hairs on the posteromedial area of the mesoscutum, and 
                 most of the scutellum. The eyes range between grayish green, dark gray, and bluish and the underside of flagellar segments 3-11 are black 
                 to dark reddish brown with a small rufescent ventral spot on each individual segment. The apical one-half of the mandibles are rufescent 
                 (bases black without any macula) and the clypeus is mostly yellow, differing at its posterior most one-third to two-thirds, which are 
                 black, and the apical margin, which is brown. The wing veins are black to dark brownish red and the apical areas of the terga are colorless 
                 to brownish yellow hyaline. The first flagellar segment’s minimum length is approximately one-fifth to one-seventh of the second segment’s 
                 maximum length, and when in repose, the flagella reach the pterostigma. The clypeus is flat without a large bulge or concavity and the 
                 length of the penultimate flagellar segment is less than three times its width. The sixth sternum’s subapical oblique carina is either 
                 absent or reduced, becoming indistinct. The head hairs are mostly pale ochraceous to white with several brown hairs atop the vertex. The 
                 thoracic hairs are white on the lateral areas, white on the mesoscutum with a large posteromedial patch of dark brown hairs that’s often 
                 smaller than twice the size of the scutellar dark patch, dark brown hairs on the tegulae, and dark brown on the scutellum with white hairs on the periphery. The first 
                 tergum has white hairs at its base, but laterally, these hairs reach the apex of the tergum. The apicomedial apubescent area has simple, 
                 dark brown, short hairs that reach the apical margin. The basal area of the second tergum bears white hairs. The interband zone of the 
                 second tergum bears wire-like, erect to suberect, brown to white hairs. The distal pale band of the second tergum is white, connected to 
                 the basal pubescence laterally, reaches the apical margin laterally, and approximately the same width medially as the apical area. The 
                 apical area of the second tergum bears suberect to subappressed, long, dark brown hairs. The third, fourth, and fifth terga are similar 
                 to that of the second, differing at the basal tomentum, which is brown; the apical areas, which are narrower to completely absent; and 
                 the interband zones, which have white hairs that are diffused across the surface. The sixth and seventh terga are covered in pale brown 
                 to yellow hairs.

                    <br><br>
              ♀ Generally a pale bee often having the hairs on terga 2-4 ochraceous-yellow. The eyes are grayish green to blue and the wing veins are 
              black. The underside of flagellar segments 3-10 are black to faintly dark brownish red. The length of the forewing including the tegulae 
              measures to be 7.0 to 8.5 mm. and the pygidial plate is V-shaped acutely. The distal pubescent band of the second tergum is narrowly 
              interrupted, and the hairs on the inner surfaces of the hind basitarsi are dark. The third tergum’s distal pale pubescent band reaches 
              the apical margin minimally laterally and often more, but if the apical area is present, then it’s glabrous, impunctate, and narrower than 
              that of the second tergum’s distal band. The apical area of the first tergum is often opaque and the length of the second flagellar 
              segment is less than, or equal to, its width. The head hairs are mostly yellow to pale ochraceous with many brown hairs on the vertex. 
              The thoracic hairs are pale ochraceous to white on the lateral areas, ochraceous to yellow with a large posteromedial patch of dark brown 
              hairs that reaches the anterior margins of the tegulae on the mesoscutum, dark brown hairs on the tegulae, and dark brown with ochraceous hairs on the periphery of the 
              scutellum. The first tergum bears ochracous hairs basally, and has short, dark brown, subappressed hairs on the anteriolateral rounded 
              projections on the apical area. The basal area of the second tergum bears pale ochraceous hairs. The interband zone of the second tergum 
              bears wire-like, dark brown, suberect to erect hairs. The distal pale band of the second tergum is ochraceous, connected to the basal 
              pubescence laterally, and narrowly medially interrupted due to the presence of brown hairs. The apical area of the second tergum bears 
              simple, long, suberect to subappressed, dark brown hairs apart from the apicomedial area, which is narrowly glabrous. The third tergum is 
              similar to that of the second, differing at the basal tomentum, which is brown; the distal pubescent band, which is complete and reaches 
              the apical margin of the tergum, minimally so in the lateral areas, and sometimes across more; and the apical area, which is much narrower 
              to entirely absent. The fourth tergum is similar to the third, but the distal pale pubescent band reaches the apex across the entire tergum, 
              and sometimes that are a few dark brown hairs at the apical margin in less than, or equal to, the medial one-fourth of the tergum. The fifth 
              and sixth terga are covered in dark brown hairs, but the fifth tergum sometimes have some lateral tufts of ochraceous hairs.

                   <p style="line-height: 1.5;"> M. microstictus is quite a distinctive bee in Oregon due to the flagellar coloration. As stated above, this species is weakly allied with M. menuachus and M. paululus, but both sexes greatly differ.
</p>
                    <p style="line-height: 1.5;">
                    ♂ Males are highly distinctive in Oregon due to their near entirely black antennae and the posterior one-third to two-thirds of the 
                    clypeaus being darkened. M. paululus can have a similar darkened clypeal coloration, but the terga are opaque and the antennae have flagellar 
                    depressions, separating it further from M. microstictus. Due to this, no other Oregonian Melissodes resemble males and further comparisons are unnecessary. 


<p style="line-height: 1.5;">
               ♀ Females can be similar to a few Oregonian Melissodes, but seems to most resemble those of M. paululus due to the same blunt-ended appearance of the 
               anterior mesoscutal hairs. M. microstictus distinctly differs from this species in that the underside of the flagellar segments are much darker, 
               nearing full black antennae with just a few dark brownish red colored maculae on a few segments. In contrast, M. paululus and M. menuachus have 
               the underside of flagellar segments 3-10 rufescent. The vestiture of M. microstictus can look similar to those of the druriellus group (M. druriellus, 
               M. pallidisignatus, and M. grindeliae), but females can be separated from this group by the distal pubescent band of the second tergum being narrowly 
               interrupted, the darkened flagella, and the hairs on the inner surfaces of the hind basitarsi being dark. In contrast, all females of the druriellus 
               group have rufescent colorations on the underside of their flagella, often lighter hairs on the inner surfaces of the hind basitarsi (not always), 
               and the second tergum’s distal pale pubescent band is complete.

M. microstictus is a likely oligolege of Asteraceae, and according to the flower records presented by Laberge (1961) this species seems to be frequently 
found atop Aster, Solidago, Helianthus, Grindeliae, Erigeron, Guterrezia, and Chysothamnus. According to Laberge (1961), of the 104 M. microstictus collected 
with floral accounts, 89 were found atop plants of the family Asteraceae, but no single genera seemed to be of preference.

                  <p style="line-height: 1.5;">
            Melissodes minusculus is very closely related to M. ablusus, and as stated by Laberge (1961), may in fact be a different morph of this species. 
            The males are the most similar, having near identical flagellar structure, sternal structure, and very similar sculpturing, separated only by 
            vestiture color. Females share this same allyship as well, both having very similar sculptures (especially the galeae) and structures, differing 
            mostly in the vestiture. Males are distinctive in that F4-F10 have depressions; the length of the penultimate flagellar segment is two times 
            its width or less; the galeae are matte and dull dorsally due to coarse, dense, and regular tessellation; the first flagellar segment’s minimum 
            length is less than one-fifth of the second segment’s maximum length; the hairs on the sixth and seventh terga are white to gold-colored and the 
            hairs on the basal half of terga 3-5 are pale brown to ochraceous. Females are distinctive in that the first tergum’s crowded basal punctures 
            usually extend to the basal half medially. The medial one-third of the first tergum has punctures that are mostly separated by one puncture width 
            or less, minimally basally and sometimes more; the galeae are matte and dull above due to coarse, dense, regular tessellation; the hairs on the 
            inner surfaces of the hind basitarsi are dark red to dark brown; the hairs on the head are entirely white apart from the brown vertex hairs (no 
            dark hairs below the vertex). Although this species has yet to be found in Oregon, its range may have a possibility of overlap, and is herein 
            accounted for in the guide. Given how closely related M. ablusus and M. minusculus are, and the singular M. ablusus Oregonian observation straying 
            quite far from its historically recognized range, there is a possibility that the specimen collected from Oregon is M. minusulus rather than M. 
            ablusus, although this is just speculation. M. minusculus currently has a total of 65 publicly available records, which seem to indicate that this 
            species is active between the months of June and August, with peak activity occurring in July (Fig. ??).

                <h3 class="sub-heading" style="font-size: 18px;"><b><i>Field Markers</i></b></h3>
                    <p style="line-height: 1.5;">
             ♂ A pale bee, paler than those of M. ablusus, with bluish gray to gray, and on rare occasions, greenish blue eyes. The mandibular bases 
             and clypeus are cream to pale yellow and the entire labrum (apical margin not darkened) is yellow. The underside flagellar segments 2-11 
             are red to yellow (these segments are dark brown to dark red on top) and the wing veins are reddish brown to red. Terga 2-5 are sometimes 
             yellow hyaline apically, but usually opaque brown. The first flagellar segment’s minimum length is less than one-fifth of the second 
             segment’s maximum length, and segments 3-10 (sometimes also on 11 near the base) have shiny, shallow, longitudinal dorsolateral depressions. 
             The length of the penultimate segments is equal to, or less than, to times its width and the ultimate segment’s length is less than three 
             times its width. The fourth sternum has a wide hyaline flap that isn’t medially shallowly emarginate (or if so then very shallowly and 
             indistinctly so), and the fifth and third sterna are noticeably apically convex. The galeae are matte and dull dorsally due to coarse, 
             dense, and regular tessellation. The overall vestiture is mostly pale ochraceous, differing at the vertex of the head, which is ochraceous 
             to yellowish; the mesoscutum and scutellum, which are also ochraceous to yellowish; the basal tomentum terga three, four, and five, which 
             is dark brown in the basal most areas; the sixth and seventh terga, which are golden brown to ochraceous; the inner surfaces of the basitarsi 
             and distitarsi, which are red to yellow (predominantly red on the middle basitarsi and hind basitarsi). The distal pale band of the second 
             tergum is complete and reaches the apex of the tergum minimally laterally. The distal pale bands of the third and fourth tergum reach the 
             apex of the tergum minimally laterally, and the interband zones bear pale pubescence that diffuses across the integument. 

                    <br><br>
            ♀ Very pale and small bee measuring around 9-10 mm. in length. The eyes are often gray to bluish-gray and the wing veins are dark brown. 
            The underside of F3-F10, and usually the apical area of F2 are yellow to reddish. The hairs on the inner surfaces of the hind basitarsi are 
            dark red to dark brown. The hairs on the head are entirely white apart from the brown vertex hairs; there are no dark hairs below the vertex. 
            The galeae are matte and dull above due to coarse, dense, regular tessellation. The first tergum’s crowded basal punctures usually extend to 
            the basal half medially. The medial one-third of the first tergum has punctures that are mostly separated by one puncture width or less, 
            minimally basally and sometimes more. The head hairs are mostly white, apart from the vertex, which has several dark brown hairs. The thoracic 
            hairs are mostly white as well, differing at the mesoscutum, which has pale ochraceous hairs and a large patch of dark hairs that sometimes 
            reaches the median of the tegulae, but never reaches past; and the scutellum, which has a few scarce medial dark brown hairs. The basal one-half 
            of the first tergum bears ochraceous hairs and the apical area bears simple, minute, appressed, sparse, dark brown hairs. The basal pubescence 
            of the second tergum is white, and the interband zone minimally bears suberect brown hairs in the medial areas, and sometimes more. The distal 
            pale pubescent band of the second tergum is wide, medially interrupted narrowly, and reaches the apex of the tergum laterally. The basal tomentum 
            of the third tergum is dark brown and the interband zone bears white hairs that diffuse across the integument. The distal pale band of the third 
            tergum reaches the apex across the entire, or most of, the tergum, and is complete. The fourth tergum also has dark brown basal tomentum and an 
            uninterrupted pale band. The fifth and the sixth terga are covered in orange to pale brown hairs, often paler on the sixth terga than the fifth, 
            apart from the lateral pale tufts that are approximately equal to one-fourth to one-third of the tergum’s width.

                     <h3 class="sub-heading" style="font-size: 18px;"><b><i>Similar Species</i></b></h3>
                   <p style="line-height: 1.5;">As can be determined above, M. minusculus is very closely related to M. ablusus in both sexes. 
                    Females are similar in that the galeae are matte and dull above due to coarse, dense, regular tessellation, and the crowded 
                    punctures on the first tergum surpass the basal one-third medially. Males are similar in that F4-F10 have longitudinal depressions, 
                    the length of the penultimate flagellar segment is two times its width or less, and that the galeae are matte and dull.

</p>
                    <p style="line-height: 1.5;">
                  ♂ Males can be separated from those of M. ablusus only with some difficulty. The two differ in that the hairs on the sixth and 
                  seventh terga are white to gold-colored in M. minusculus, and the hairs on the basal half of terga 3-5 are pale brown to ochraceous. 
                  In M. ablusus, the hairs on the sixth and seventh terga are mostly brown and the hairs on the basal half terga 3-5 are mostly brown 
                  as well. These species are very challenging to separate and even more difficult without a reference to compare. Males of M. 
                  minusculus are also similar to those of M. clarkiae given the shared antennal structure, but can be separated by the densely 
                  tesselated and dulled galeae. In contrast, the galeae of M. clarkiae are also somewhat dulled, but only by delicate reticular 
                  shagreening rather than dense tessellation.



<p style="line-height: 1.5;">
             ♀ Females differ from those of M. ablusus in that the hairs on the inner surfaces of the hind basitarsi are dark red to dark brown, 
             and the hairs on the head are entirely white apart from the brown vertex hairs; there are no dark hairs below the vertex. In contrast, 
             for minusculus the hairs on the inner surfaces of the hind basitarsi are black to dark reddish brown, and the hairs on the head are 
             entirely, or almost entirely, dark brown; minimally there are dark and pale hairs mixed on the face below the vertex. To an extent, 
             females also resemble those of M. plumosus, but can be quickly separated by the mate and dull galeal sculpture. Due to the specific 
             characters listed above, females of M. minusculus don’t directly resemble any other species.

                   <p style="line-height: 1.5;">
         Melissodes nigracauda is highly distinctive in both sexes. Males are interesting as they are the only Callimelissodes in Oregon to have no flagellar 
         depressions, and females are also unusual as they are the only Callimelissodes in Oregon to have dark scopae. Males are distinctive in that the first 
         flagellar segment’s minimum length is more than one-fourth of the second segment’s maximum length; the flagella have no shallow narrow depressions 
         laterally, at most, some segments might have some flattened areas; the galeae are matte and dulled dorsally due to regular, dense tessellation; the 
         fourth sternum is widely convex apically. Females are distinctive in that the majority of the scopal hairs are dark brown, sometimes paler brown 
         medially; the metasomal hairs are mostly dark brown to black (sometimes there is a small amount of paler pubescence on the second tergum); the galeae 
         have dense tessellation. This species isn’t related to a single other Callimelissodes, but females can resemble those of M. bicoloratus and dark forms 
         of M. bimatris due to similar vestiture. This is interesting as the only three Melissodes in the entire genus that exhibit this darkened vestiture with 
         ochraceous highlights (M. nirgracuda, M. bicoloratus, and dark forms of M. bimatrus) also occur, or likely occur, in Oregon, suggesting these vestiture 
         colorations possibly play a role in keeping these species safe. Furthermore, both M. bicoloratus and M. bimatris seem to prefer the genera Ericameria 
         and Chrysothamnus (both similar plants in structure), which are similarly colored to the ochraceous dorsal pubescence, potentially allowing for better 
         camouflage against predators (M. nigracauda has too few records to justify a flower preference). Given the lack of antennal depressions males can 
         resemble a few other Eumelissodes superficially, although to a lesser extent than the females due to the subgeneric characters. Although it has yet 
         to be found in Oregon, a 2024 survey from the Washington State Department of Agriculture yielded results of M. nigracauda occurring in Washington. 
         When pairing this with its Southern Californian observations, it would be surprising if this species doesn’t occur in Oregon (Fig. ??).  M. nigracauda 
         has been recorded to be active between the months of June to September, with peak activity occurring in September (Fig. ??).

                    <p style="line-height: 1.5;">
           ♂ A very pale bee with few dark hairs. The eyes are grayish blue to gray and the wing veins are black to dark reddish brown. The mandibular bases 
           and clypeus are cream colored to pale yellow and the labrum is white apart from the narrow brown apical margin. The underside of flagellar 
           segments 2-11 are red to yellow. The first flagellar segment's minimum length is longer than, or equal to, one-fourth of the second segment's 
           maximum length. The penultimate and ultimate flagellar segments are minimally three times their width. The flagella do not have dorsolateral 
           longitudinal depressions like many other Callimelissodes, but rather flagellar segments 5-11, and often the basal areas of the fourth segment, 
           are noticeably compressed and have shiny flattened areas. The fourth sternum is apically widely convex, and usually very shallowly medially emarginate. 
           The apical margins of sterna 3 and five are only very slightly convex, and can almost appear as being transverse if not viewed from afar. The hairs on 
           the head are entirely ochraceous. The thoracic hairs are also entirely ochraceous, but the hairs on the mesoscutum and scutellum tend to be faintly 
           darker. The metasomal hairs are ochraceous, differing at the apical area of the first tergum, which has short, appressed, dark brown hairs; the apical 
           areas of terga two and four, and usually the medial areas of the fifth tergum as well, which have similar apical hairs to that of the second; the basal 
           areas of the third, fourth, and fifth terga, which have dark brown tomenum; the sternal hairs, which are yellow to brownish in the medial areas, 
           becoming pale ochraceous laterally. The leg hairs are mostly ochraceous apart from the orange to yellow hairs on the inner surfaces of the tarsi. 


                    <br><br>
         ♀ A very dark bee, not the darkest in Oregon (M. pullatellus), but nearing so. Minimally, flagellar segments 4-10, and often 3 as well, are rufescent 
         and although not explicitly stated by Laberge (1961), some M. nigracauda females, when alive, may have very dark blue eyes. The majority of the scopal 
         hairs are dark brown, sometimes paler brown medially, and the metasomal hairs are mostly dark brown to black (sometimes there is a small amount of 
         paler pubescence on the second tergum). The galeae have dense tessellation and the scopal hairs are highly branched, having more than three branches 
         on either side of each rachis. The surface of the first tergum is somewhat shiny, but dulled due to sense reticulotransverse shagreening and the basal 
         one-half has indistinct, sparse, and incredibly shallow punctures. The apical one-half of the first tergum is entirely impunctate. The punctures in the 
         basal area of the second tergum are minute, mostly separated by three to four puncture diameters, and the surface of this area is shiny. The interband 
         zone of the second tergum bears indistinct punctures sparsely located around the integument and the apical area is entirely impunctate; the microsculpture 
         of these surfaces are similar to the shagreening of the first tergum. The third and fourth terga are similar to that of the second. The pygidial plate is 
         shaped like a triangle with a wide base, the tip becoming pointed rather than apically rounded as in most Melissodes. The head hairs are almost entirely 
         black to dark brown, apart from the vertex and the areas around the antennal fossae, which may sometimes have a few pale hairs. The thoracic hairs are 
         black to dark brown, differing at the tegulae, mesoscutal, scutellar, and dorsal propodeal surfaces, which bear ochraceous to faintly rufescent hairs. 
         The metasomal hairs are black to dark brown, differing at the basal one-half of the first tergum, which usually has some long pale hairs mixed with the 
         dark pubescence; the distal pale band of the third tergum, which usually has a few ochraceous hairs laterally, but sometimes entirely dark. The apical 
         hairs of the second and third terga are dark brown, simple, sparse, appressed and minute. The leg hairs are mostly black to dark brown with the hind 
         tibial, and sometimes basitarsal scopal hairs airing more towards a dark brownish hue rather than black (scopae dark).

                   <p style="line-height: 1.5;">M. nigracauda females only resemble two other Melissodes, M. bicoloratus and dark forms of M. bimatris, 
                    both of which occur or likely occur in Oregon. Males on the other hand are quite distinctive due to the structure of the fourth sternum 
                    (a Callimelissodes subgeneric characteristic), and the lack of antennal depressions. For this reason, only a female comparison will be 
                    given, as no other Oregonian Melissodes exhibit the traits of these males.

                    <p style="line-height: 1.5;">
                 ♀ Given the darkend vestiture with prominent ochraceous pubescence on the dorsal areas of the thorax and somtimes head, M. nigracauda 
                 resembles the foregoing species. Females can be separated from those of M. bimatris much easier than from those of M. bicoloratus in the 
                 color of the scopae. M. nigracauda has dark, near-black scopal hairs whereas M. bimatris has bright ochraceous to pale fluvo-ochraceous 
                 scopae, often lighter than their dorsal thoracic pubescence. On the other hand, M. bicoloratus shares this same scopal hair coloration, 
                 and the two are instead most easily separated by galeal sculpture. M. nigracauda has distinctly shagreened galeae whereas M. bicoloratus 
                 has shiny unshagreened galeae. Furthermore, the two can be separated by subgeneric characteristics as M. bicoloratus resides in Eumelissodes 
                 and M. nigracauda resides in Callimelissodes. </p>

                    <p style="line-height: 1.5;">
Although the lack of sufficient flower data aren’t indicative of certain diet preferences, the flowers from which M. nigracauda has 
been seen will be listed. All flower records included in this list are from reports in the literature or datasets. Each flower has a 
parenthesized reference listed after it, corresponding to the literary work or dataset in which it was recorded. Currently, M. 
nigracauda has been found atop Erigeron sp. (Laberge, 1961), Senecio flaccidus var. douglasii (Laberge, 1961; historical synonym), 
Stephanomeria sp. (Laberge, 1961), Stephanomeria exigua (Laberge, 1961), Stephanomeria virgata (Laberge, 1961). Counterintuitively, 
the flower records show no indications of M. nigracauda even visiting Ericameria or Chrysothamnus, suggesting that this species is 
further separated from both M. bimatris and M. bicoloratus not only in morphology, but in diet as well.

                   <p style="line-height: 1.5;">
        Melissodes pallidisignatus, the pale striped long-horn bee, is highly variable in both sexes and closely related to M. druriellus. 
        Males are distinctive in that the length of the penultimate flagellar segment is always less than three times its width (maximum 
        length and narrowest width); the labrum has a yellow macula, and the mandibles can have maculae (often a small basal pale macula 
        in this region if present), but are often entirely black; when in repose, the antennae usually do not reach the pterostigma; the 
        apical areas of terga 2-5 are colorless to testaceous or brownish yellow hyaline; the basal areas of terga 4-6 are covered in pale 
        pubescence and hairs. Females are distinctive in two manners due to their variation, that being apical suberect pale hairs near the 
        distal pubescent band of the third tergum are either present or absent, separating females into two groups. Group 1 of females are 
        distinctive in that the distal band on the third tergum often reaches the apex of the tergum at extreme lateral areas; the pale 
        hairs on the mesoscutum positioned anteriorly to the dark patch of hairs are pale ochraceous to white; the scopal hairs are ochraceous; 
        the first tergum is reticularly shagreened and the punctures are small, distinct, and approximately separated by one-half of a 
        puncture width; the interband zone of the second tergum is shiny, not dull; the mesoscutum clearly has a dark brown to black patch 
        of posteromedial hairs; the clypeus rarely protrudes beyond the eye by one-half of an eye’s width in profile, almost always by less; 
        the apical area of the third tergum either bears some erect pale somewhat simple hairs, or is glabrous, impunctate, and narrower 
        than that of the second tergum’s distal band. Group two of females are distinctive in that the length of the forewing including 
        the tegulae measures to be 9 to 10 mm; the lateral raised areas of the interband zone of the second tergum have distinct punctures 
        that are of two sizes, some large and rather posteriorly directed, and the other that is tiny; the hairs on the inner surfaces of 
        the hind basitarsi are dark brown; the underside of most of the flagella is rufescent; and the apical area of the third tergum is 
        either glabrous, impunctate, and widely triangularly shaped, although no wider than around one-third of the tergum’s width, or. 
        However, many females found in Oregon seem to be much darker (the darkest M. pallidisignatus ever found was in Oregon), often 
        having its distal pale band on the third tergum composed partially of dark hairs. This species has been found across the majority 
        of Oregon, with a few notable records in Crater Lake-Klamath Marsh, where the darkest known females reside. M. pallidisignatus was 
        originally known to be active between the months of June to October with peak activity occurring in August (Laberge, 1961), but 
        newer data show that this species has been observed during May as well (Fig. ??).

                    <p style="line-height: 1.5;">
          ♂ Often a pale bee, hence the vernacular name, but setal coloration varies, be it not substantially. The eyes are grayish 
          blue to green and the wing veins are dark brown to red. The mandibular bases can be one of three varieties, entirely black, 
          have a small round pale macula, or have a large triangular macula. However, the majority of males collected in Oregon (and in 
          most western regions as well) often have no macula to very small basal pale macula. No males have currently been found that bear 
          large triangular yellow maculae. The clypeus is yellow and the underside of flagellar segments 2-11 are red to yellow. The apical 
          areas of the terga are dark brownish red to colorless hyaline and the labrum bears a mediobasal pale macula that ranges from 
          small to large in size. The minimum length of the first flagellar segment is approximately one-fourth to one-third of the second 
          segment’s maximum length, and the length of the penultimate flagellar segment is less than three times its width. When in repose, 
          the flagella do not reach the prestigma. Similar to the females, males can vary in setal coloration, although to a much less extent 
          and more variation within a given population occurs. Males vary in the sculptures of the galeae, base of the first tergum, and the 
          interband zones of the second and third terga. Across most of Oregon, males (dark and pale alike, no correlation seems to be present 
          between vestiture and sculpting; see setal variation below) seem to present a ratio of approximately 50:50 of shiny terga and galeae 
          to dulled terga and galeae. Note that in this region, there seems to be more of an emphasis on shagreening, therefore “shiny” isn’t 
          completely unshagreened, rather less dense than the dulled variant. Although these are common in Oregon, interpopulational variation 
          is present. As no documentations of variation in Oregon have been published since 1961, a general statement will also be given to 
          account for any unfound sculptural variation using range-wide extremes. The tergal and galeal sculpture of males ranges from shiny 
          with no to very faint shagreening, to densely shagreened and dull. The setal description given below will be broadened to include 
          the different morphs of males that occur range wide, with parenthesised annotations for characters that are often Oregon specific 
          in accordance to Laberge (1961). Due to this, integumental and structural features should be used when identifying M. pallidisignatus. <br><br>

          The hairs on the head are white to pale ochraceous, but on the vertex, the hairs may be brown (often brown in Oregon). The thoracic 
          hairs are mostly white to pale ochraceous as well, but the scutellum usually has some dark medial hairs (varying amounts per individual, 
          but also often present in Oregon), the tegulae rarely has brown hairs (darkest Oregonian specimens may), and the mesoscutal hairs tend to 
          be abundantly dark brown (predominantly in western individuals, including those of this range). The hairs on the dorsum of the thorax range 
          from being long and somewhat erect, to erect and short (often short to medium length hairs that are truncated/blunt-ended in Oregon, but 
          not always). The first tergum has long basal white to ochraceous hairs and long appressed to subappressed apical pale hairs that reach the 
          apex across the tergum but don’t obscure the apical portion medially; sometimes not obscuring the apical margin laterally as well. The 
          second tergum has white to rich brown basal pubescence (often darker in males from Oregon) and pale suberect, bristle-like hairs on the 
          interband zone. The distal pubescent band of the second tergum is anteriorly separated from the apex of the tergum by about one-half to 
          one times the length of the medial area of the pale band and is not interrupted medially. Terga 3-5 are similar to that of the second 
          tergum except for the interband zones, which in addition to the bristle-like hairs there are also delicate, sparse, white, appressed 
          pubescence. Also, the distal bands of terga 3-5 become closer to the apical margin with each tergum. The sixth and seventh terga are 
          covered in yellowish to white pubescence. The sternal hairs are medially reddish to pale ochraceous, and laterally white. The legs are 
          white to ochraceous excluding the pale rufescent to golden yellow inner surfaces of the tarsi.

        ♀ Females, like their male counterparts, are widely variable, but to a much higher extreme. In general females are moderately pale (similar in 
        color to M. druriellus) to distinctly dark (nearing levels of M. metenuus or M. rivalis). The eyes are bluish gray to gray and the wing veins 
        are brownish red to black ( often becoming paler in eastern individuals, but light wing veins may be present in Oregon as well). The underside 
        of flagellar segments 3-10 are rufescent and in the paler individuals, the apical tergal one-halves are rufescent. Females have two variations 
        of the apical area of the third tergum bears its hairs, one in which the apical area of the third tergum is glabrous, apart from a few suberect 
        hairs that are sometimes present near the distal most area of the pubescent band with the apical area approximately as wide as the band medially, 
        and one in which the apical area is glabrous and triangularly shaped with the distal pale band reaching the apex laterally. The apical area of 
        the second tergum is glabrous (a few dark appressed short hairs may be present near the band, but often not), impunctate, and shiny with incredibly 
        faint reticulotransverse shagreening. The interband zone of the second tergum ranges from being dull due to dense reticular shagreening (highly 
        contrasts with the apical area sculpturing; common characteristic of Oregon females) to less densely shagreened but still contrasting with the 
        apical area. The mesoscutum clearly has a dark brown to black patch of posteromedial hairs (sometimes when dark enough, the entire mesoscutum is 
        black). The clypeus rarely protrudes beyond the eye by one-half of an eye’s width in profile, almost always by less. The interband zone of the 
        second tergum is distinctly punctate and the length of the forewing including the tegulae measures to be 9 to 10 mm. The lateral raised areas of 
        the interband zone of the second tergum have distinct punctures. These punctures are of two sizes, some large and rather posteriorly directed, 
        nd the other that is tiny. The hairs on the inner surfaces of the hind basitarsi are dark brown. Although a few descriptions of the setae have 
        been given, it is apparent from these that females are highly variable in this manner. Laberge (1961) noted that most females from Oregon (especially 
        in the Crater Lake-Klamath marsh area) are distinctly dark, some of the darkest in the entire range (see table 4). However, no studies since have 
        been conducted to find if this holds true in current times. Therefore, a similar structure to that of Table 3 in the M. druriellus description 
        will be given below. This table was derived from characteristics listed in the geographical variation section in the M. pallidisignatus 
        description from Laberge (1961). Preceding this, a general pale description will be given to which the characters in table 4 modify.
                <br><br>

                The head hairs are mostly pale ochraceous to white, apart from the vertex, which bears many dark hairs. The thoracic hairs are 
                also mostly pale ochraceous to white, except as follows: the scutellar hairs, which are mostly dark brown; the mesoscutum, which 
                often has a large patch of dark posteromedial hairs that’s minimally equal to the size of the scutellar dark patch, and often 
                twice the size (the dark mesoscutal patch usually has a few pale hairs mixed with the dark hairs in the anterior areas). The 
                first tergum’s basal area has long, pale ochraceous hairs that reach the apical margin at extreme lateral areas but not medially. 
                The apical area of the first tergum is glabrous. The second tergum’s pale ochraceous basal pubescence laterally connects to the 
                distal pale band. The interband zone of the second tergum has rather simple, subappressed, sparse pale ochraceous hairs along 
                with a few wire-like erect hairs. The distal pale ochraceous pubescent band is often separated from the apical margin laterally 
                (apart from rare occurrences), and medially, the band is narrowed and notched. The apical area is glabrous. The third tergum is 
                similar to that of the second, except the basal tomentum is dark brown and the distal pale band usually reaches the apical 
                margin laterally, but not medially. The apical area of the third tergum is glabrous, apart from a few suberect hairs that are 
                sometimes present near the distal most area of the pubescent band, and approximately as wide at the distal pale band medially. 
                The fourth tergum is similar to that of the third, but the distal pale band reaches the apex across the entire tergum. The fifth 
                and sixth terga are entirely covered in brown hairs excluding the white lateral tufts. The sternal hairs are almost entirely 
                brownish red apart from the apical areas of the fifth sternum. The leg hairs are mostly pale ochraceous, differing at the 
                bastitibial plates, which are dark brown; the fore tibiae and middle tibiae, which are often pale brown on the outer apical 
                areas; the middle and hind basitarsi, which are dark brown; the fore basitari and often the distitarsi, which are also dark 
                brown.

                Many levels of melanism seem to exist within females of M. pallidisignatus across its range. 8 characteristics each having three 
                different levels of melanism derived from descriptions of Laberge (1961) to account for these variations rather than writing 
                singular descriptions for each theoretical variety (6, 561 or 3^8 possible morphs). These are listed in the table below (table 4). 
                Traits of differing levels of melanism are meant to be applied to, and override portions of, the pale description above. Note that 
                each value per character (light, intermediate, or dark) is treated as being independent from one another (although, many are highly 
                correlated). Therefore, a female M. pallidisignatus may have all of its head hairs dark (darkest choice for the first character), 
                and also have a pale band across the fourth tergum (palest choice for the sixth character).

                     <h3 class="sub-heading" style="font-size: 18px;"><b><i>Similar Species</i></b></h3>
                   <p style="line-height: 1.5;">M. pallidisignatus is very similar to M. druriellus, both in vestiture variation 
                    and superficial resemblance. Males of M. pallidisignatus are much more similar to those of the first group of M. 
                    druriellus (see M. druriellus description) due to the same antennal structure, but differ in 2 or more characters. 
                    Females on the other hand, although closely allied with M. druriellus, can resemble a number of other Eumelissodes 
                    in multiple morphs (although, the existence of the palest morph in Oregon is unknown). 

</p>
                    <p style="line-height: 1.5;">
                ♂ Males can be seperated from those of the first group of druriellus in two ways. The first is that certain individuals of M. 
                pallidisignatus may have mandibles that bear a basal yellow macula (likely a small pale yellow macula is present as no males with 
                large triangular maculae have been found in Oregon). However, as stated above, this is a very rare occurrence from this state and 
                the males often have entirely black mandibular bases; similar in integumental color to those of M. druriellus. The most reliable 
                way to separate the two species is by the tergal rims. M. druriellus has its terga almost completely opaque to very deeply infumate
                dark brown, whereas M. pallidisignatus has its tergal rims hyaline yellow to brown. Males are also somewhat similar to group one of 
                M. grindeliae males (see M. grindeliae description) as they share similar antennal structures as well. The two can be separated in 
                that M. pallidisignatus have mediobasal cream to yellow colored maculae on their labrum whereas group one of M. grindelae have their 
                labrums entirely black.
</p>

<p style="line-height: 1.5;">
              ♀ Females are most similar to M. druriellus and M. grindeliae, but probably more so the former than the latter. M. pallidisignatus can be 
              separated from those of m. druriellus by the distal pale band on the third tergum, which reaches the apex laterally; the hairs anterior 
              to the mesoscutal dark patch, which are ochraceous to white; the scopae, which are ochraceous; ant the pictures on the first tergum, 
              which are small, distinct, and approximately separated by one-half of a puncture width. In contrast, M. druriellus’ distal pale band on 
              the third tergum does not reach the apex across the entire tergum and is instead well-separated from it; the pale hairs on the mesoscutum 
              anterior to the dark patch of hairs are usually rusty-reddish; the scopae are usually a golden-yellow color; and the punctures on the 
              first tergum are incredibly shallow, large, and crowded (these punctures are usually obscured by shagreening). Females can be separated 
              from those of M. grindeliae by the distinctly punctate interband zone of the second tergum. In contrast, the interband zone is impuncate 
              or essentially so. In its darkest morph, females look somewhat similar to those of M. rivalis due to the presence of white metasomal hairs 
              (M. druriellus’ dark form is entirely black), but can be easily separated by the inner eye portions, which converge towards the mandibles 
              in facial view rather than being parallel to one another. Although other Melissodes may bear a resemblance to the many forms of females 
              of M. pallidisignatus, the foregoing species are the ones which seem to hold the highest similarities.

                    <p style="line-height: 1.5;">
M. pallidisignatus is an oligolege of Asteraceae, and according to the flower records presented by Laberge (1961) this species seems 
to be frequently found atop Isocoma, Chrysothamnus, Grendeliae, and Solidago. According to Laberge (1961), of the 333 M. pallidisignatus 
collected with floral accounts, 279 were found atop plants of the family Asteraceae, but no single genera from the list above seems to be 
of significant preference. However, newer data also suggest that the genera Heterotheca and Ericameria are of importance to this species

<b>Clypeus</b> (plural, clypei; in reference to, clypeal): a large facial sclerite that is somewhat equivalent to the beginning of the nose to the beginning of the lip area on humans.<br><br>
<b>Labrum</b> (in reference to, labral): a medium sized facial sclerite that is smaller than the clypeus and often tucked under the clypeus unless the galeae are extended.<br><br>
<b>Galea</b> (plural, galeae; in reference to, galeal): the outer covering of the tongue.<br><br>
<b>Oculoclypeal distance</b>: the distance between the lateral area of the clypeus and the inner margin of the eye just above the mandibles.<br><br>
<b>Supraclypeal area</b>: the facial sclerite located right above the clypeus.<br><br>
<b>Vertex</b>: the top portion of the head between the apices of the compound eyes.<br><br>
<b>Postocular area</b>: the exoskeletal area behind and lateral to the compound eyes (genal area).<br><br>
<b>Mesoscutum</b> (in reference to, mesoscutal): the large dorsal thoracic plate; when looking at the dorsum of the thorax, this is the anterior plate.<br><br>
<b>Scutellum</b> (in reference to, scutellar): the medium to smaller sized dorsal thoracic plate; when looking at the dorsum of the thorax, this is the posterior plate.<br><br>
<b>Metanotum</b> (in reference to, metanotal): the small dorsal thoracic plate located just posteriorly to the scutellum, but anteriorly to the dorsum of the propodeum.<br><br></div>
  <div class="right" id="text"><b>Propodeum</b> (in reference to, propodeal): the posterior most thoracic segment that’s fused to the first tergum.<br><br>
<b>Tegula</b> (plural, tegulae; in reference to, tegular): a small sclerite covering the base of the forewing.<br><br>
<b>Pronotum</b> (in reference to, pronotal): the anterior most thoracic segment.<br><br>

<b>Mesopleura</b> (in reference to, mesopleural): the lateral area of the thorax including the lateral areas of the propodeum and pronotum.<br><br>
<b>Mesonotum</b> (in reference to, mesonotal): entirety of the dorsum of the thorax.<br><br>
<b>Metasoma</b> (in reference to, metasomal): the posterior most body segment (abdomen).<br><br>
<b>Tergum</b> (plural, terga; in reference to, tergal): the dorsal surface of the metasoma, however, used as meaning each segment or tergite and reference to the dorsum of the metasoma will be stated clearly.<br><br>
<b>Sternum</b> (plural, sterna; in reference to, sternal): a ventral metasomal segment (i.e. the “other side” of a tergum).<br><br>
<b>Pygidial plate</b>: a small sclerotized plate on the posterior portion of the metasoma usually forming a sort of pointed process.<br><br>
<b>Tibia</b> (plural, tibiae; in reference to, tibial): the second major segment of the legs.<br><br>
<b>Basitibial plate</b>: a small sclerotized plate located at the base of a tibia somewhat resembling a kneecap.<br><br>
<b>Tarsus</b> (plural, tarsi; in reference to, tarsal): the third major segment of the legs composed of the bastitarsus, mediotarsus and distitarsi. However, the bastitarsus is referred to separately from the rest of the tarsi in this guide.<br><br>
<b>Bastitarsus</b> (plural, bastitarsi; in reference to, bastitarsal): the largest and basal most tarsal segment.<br><br>
<b>Scopa</b> (plural, scopae; in reference to, scopal): large pollen collecting hairs. On female Melissodes, these are on the hind tibiae and bastitarsi.<br><br></div>
