                  <h2 class="top-title" style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 22px; font-weight: bold;"><b>Introduction</b></h2>
                    <p style="line-height: 1.5;">Melissodes Latreille is a common genus of wild bees from the tribe Eucerini occurring in the New World 
                      (Laberge, 1956a; Laberge, 1956b; Laberge, 1961; Wright et al., 2020). As of now, a total of 129 species have been described in this 
                      genus making it the second largest in the Eucerini tribe (Wright et al., 2020). 25 of these species have been documented in Oregon 
                      (see table 1) and 8 have known ranges that overlap portions of Oregon (see table 2). Melissodes are known to be important pollinators 
                      in crops such as cotton (LaBerge, 1956), alfalfa (LaBerge, 1956), muskmelons (Winfree, et al., 2007), watermelon (Campbell et al., 
                      2018; Winfree, et al., 2007), canola (O'Brien & Arathi, 2018), and coffee (Ngo et al., 2013), but most chiefly so in sunflowers 
                      (Parker et al., 1981). Parker (1981) documented that a species of Melissodes (M. agilis) is a more proficient pollinator in sunflowers 
                      than that of the western honeybee. Although their importance has been expressed in agricultural settings (Parker, 1981) and likely in 
                      wild ecosystems due to their abundance (Laberge, 1956a), identification of Melissodes beyond genus is often scarce due to the subtle 
                      characters that differentiate between species. The genus was last revised in a three-part series by W. E. Laberge (1956a; 1956b; 1961) 
                      as well as a later correction to the M. (Callimelissodes) subgeneric key (Laberge, 1963), in which detailed species-specific treatments, 
                      generic and subgeneric keys, and distributions were first presented, representing a cornerstone for current-day Melissodes knowledge. 
                      However, the keys presented in these revisions can be, at times, slightly ambiguous and overwhelming due to the sheer number of species 
                      and intraspecific variation. As a genus, Melissodes are widespread and range over the entirety of the New World, but species differ 
                      largely in what areas they occupy (Laberge, 1956a; Laberge, 1956b; Laberge, 1961; Wright et al., 2020). Many species are restricted to 
                      South America and Central America, which, when trying to identify North American species using a key designed to include all 129 species, 
                      drastically inflates the amount of information needed to identify an individual. The same can be said for species whose ranges are 
                      restricted to specific portions of North America that differ from the location in which a specific individual was found. Herein, a key 
                      developed from that of Laberge (1956a; 1956b; 1961; 1963) using the same structure and traits but incorporating subgeneric splits and 
                      only including species who occur, or are likely to occur, in Oregon is presented. Although using a regional key such as this may not 
                      yield new state records for Oregon, apart from those whose ranges overlap this area and are included in the key, it may assist in ease 
                      of identification beyond genus allowing for species-level studies and less chances for drastic misidentification due to individual 
                      variation. Along with this, species descriptions and comparisons, derived from that of Laberge, (1956a; 1956b; 1961) are given to further 
                      aid in identification.

                    <p style="line-height: 1.5;"> 
                        This field guide is designed to aid in identifying Melissodes species in Oregon. This includes comparisons of similar genera such as Eucera and Diadasia, 
                        which have overlapping ranges and similar morphologies, comparisons of similar species within the genus, and regional keys. Ranges have been determined 
                        using historic taxonomic literature in tandem with GBIF occurrence records (see tables 1 & 2). This data was also used to evaluate distributions, phenology, 
                        and host-plant relationships. Each species has a full treatment used to assist in identification, locality, morphology, and more (species treatments are 
                        outlined below).

                    </p>

                    <h3 class="sub-heading" style="font-size: 18px;"><b><i>Species treatments</i></b></h3>
                    <p style="line-height: 1.5;">
                      Each species description consists of what follows:
Morphological descriptions, particularly of key diagnostic features with accompanying photos of the feature; distribution maps plotted in Leaflet using OpenStreetMap (OSM) 
derived from authoritative taxonomic literature (Laberge, 1956a; 1956b; 1961) and recent sampling from GBIF occurrence records to produce an up-to-date range; phenological graphs created using data from 
GBIF occurrence records; flower records and/or preference if lists are too extensive; when applicable, notes concerning taxonomic history and/or distinctive identifiers; two 
"Feild Marks" and "Similar species" sections (one per sex given the sexual diamorphism) unless stated otherwise; a 
similar naming convention to that used by the North American Native Bee Collaborative (2020) will be adapted for this guide, that being at the beginning of each species treatment, 
a group-name is given to species of similar morphologies (if a group-name is absent, then the species does not specifically resemble another and instead, the word “distinct” 
will take the place of group-name). For most species, as there is insufficient data, phenological graphs will consist of two lines, one representing phenology based on Oregon 
captures, and the other based on captures across each species respective range. Each species "Field Markers" section is based on the information given about both sexes from the genus treatment; 
if not familiar with Melissodes as a genus, reading the genus treatment is recomended before subsequent species treatments. Morphological descriptions for each species are derived from that of Laberge (1956a; 1956b; 1961).
Precursing each of the species treatments, the genus will be treated. This will not include a 
group-name as no other genera are described within this guide; similar genera will be listed instead. 

                    </p>

                    <p style="line-height: 1.5;">
                      As can be determined below, subtle differences are used in delimiting species of Melissodes. To describe these delimiting characters, terms have been 
                      applied to specific anatomical features and structures. Below is a list of Melissodes images with labeled anatomical features, the terms used to describe 
                      these features will be used throughout the guide; definitions for these terms are also in the glossary with parenthesized use cases.

                      Melissodes are perhaps one of the most commonly found wild Apid bee genera in Oregon apart from Bombus and Ceratina (Best et al., 2021b; 2022b). In general, the genus is comprised of very setaceous, robust, and medium 
                      sized bees with the largest Oregonian Melissodes (M. glenwoodensis) in length, measuring 11-14 mm. in the female sex and 10-15 mm. in the male sex (Laberge, 1961; for 
                      reference, Apis melifera measures about 13.2 mm. on average; see DeGrandi-Hoffman et al., 2004). Males and females can be readily distinguished from one another by the 
                      increadibly long antennal length of the males and the scopae on the hind legs and robustness of the females. Melissodes are ground-nesting bees (Laberge, 1956a; Laberge, 1956b; Laberge, 1961; 
                      Michener, 2007) that are most active during the fall months, with peak activity occurring in August and July (see, in part, Fig. 12). This genus is widespread across the entirety 
                      of Oregon, but each species differs slightly in range (see species treatments). Overall, Melissodes as a genus are oligolects of Asteracae, and often nest near 
                      large quantities of these flowers (Parker et al., 1981), which seems reasonable as its been reported that some species home ranges are short, likely around 14-16 meters (Foy, 2025).

                      (although there are exceptions; see M. tristis). The wings have 3 submarginal cells and the eyes tend to have a green color, though not always. The first flagellar

                      Although they are a distinctive genus, Melissodes can superficially resemble other genera, prime examples of which are 
                      Eucera and Diadasia. Male Melissodes can reliably be distinguished from that of a male Diadasia by their long antennae 
                      and anteriorly narrowed tegulae (Fig. 7), although females can bear more of a resemblance due to their robustness and scopal hair 
                      location. Female Melissodes can be differentiated from that of female Diadasia due to the anteriorly narrowed tegulae 
                      and flatter vertex outlines when looking in facial view (Michener, 2007; Laberge, 1957; see Fig. 8). Distinguishing between Melissodes 
                      and Eucera can be a bit trickier as both genera reside in the same tribe (Eucerini) and therefore males cannot be separated 
                      by antennae length alone and females share similar features. The most common way to separate both sexes of Melissodes 
                      from Eucera is with tegular shape, that being Melissodes tegulae are narrowed anteriorly and Eucera tegulae aren’t 
                      (Michener, 2007; Laberge, 1957; see Fig. 9). Males of Eucera usually have entirely black 
                      antennae with no ventral red markings and highly distinct flagellar segmentation in contrast to the often red ventral to 
                      dorsal antennal markings and less distinct flagellar segments of Melissodes (Fig. 10; male Melissodes microstictus have entirely black 
                      antennae as well, except for a ventral pale macula, but the flagellar segments are less distinct, the genal area is smaller, 
                      and the clypeus is less protuberant than that of a male Eucera). Both sexes of Eucera also tend to have 
                      larger genal area to eye ratios (not always; Fig. 11), and earlier phenological activity than that of Melissodes (Fig. 12).

                      Melissodes agilis, the agile long-horned bee, is known to be one of the most common and widespread North American Melissodes (Laberge, 1961). Unexpectedly, in Oregon, 
                      this species ranks only fifth most common in the genus with a total of 68 publicly documented state records (Fig. 13). Although not a distinctive species in general, especially in the female 
                      sex, the only resemblance M. agilis directly bears is to M. trinodis which occurs in eastern portions of the United States and Canada (Laberge, 1961). Although M. agilis is widespread across Oregon 
                      (see Fig. 18), M. trinodis doesn't seem to occupy this area and for this 
                      reason, M. agilis is labeled as distinct. Females are known to nest in and around large quantities of Asteraceae, particularly Helianthus, with daily activity beginning around 6:30 AM 
                      to 7:45 AM (likely dependent on location and temperature) and height of activity often in earlier parts of the day (Parker et al., 1981). Parker et al. (1981) found at 
                      9:00 AM, there were twice the amount of females foraging than at 11:00 AM, and at 1:00 PM there were about one-third the amount of females foraging than at 11:00 AM. It 
                      seems that most females stay in their nests during the afternoon (Parker, F. D et al., 1981). Although not enough data is yet available for Oregonian M. agilis phynology, they likely follow 
                      a similar pattern to that of rage-wide M. agilis (see Fig. 19).

                    <p style="line-height: 1.5;">
                      ♂ The flagellum is almost entirely red-colored ventrally except for the first segment. F1 is incredibly short in 
                      comparison to the rest of the flagellar segments, with its maximum length less than, or equal to, one-third of the 
                      third segment’s minimum length. The minimum length of the first flagellar segments is about one-sixth to one-fifth 
                      of the second segment’s maximum length. The penultimate flagellar segment is equal to around three times its width. 
                      The mandibles have yellow maculations on their bases and the labrum is almost entirely pale except for its darkened 
                      margin (in couplet 26, this would count as a large mediobasal pale macula and on couplet 15, these maculations do 
                      not count as large and pale as they are yellow and medium sized). The antennae have no longitudinal depressions and the clypeus
                      is yellow. The apical areas of the terga are widely hyaline, 
                      so much so that at a distance, these can look like large pale pubescent bands (they are not). The wing veins are 
                      very light red to yellow colored and the hairs on the head and thorax are minimally pale ochraceous and often pale 
                      rusty-red. The rest of the hairs on the body tend to be very pale and almost gray-colored, although in more vibrant 
                      individuals, they can be a paler ochraceous. Although not a field marker as immobilization of a specimen is needed, 
                      the galeae are dulled above due to fine reticular shagreening.<br> <br>

                      ♀ The overall vestiture is ochraceous to yellow, usually very few dark hairs if any. The impunctate apical area of the first tergum is 
                      longer than one-half of the basal punctate area and the apical area of the third tergum has no dark hairs. The mesoscutum doesn’t have a 
                      dark brown to black patch of posteromedial hairs, or if so, then very few dark hairs are present. The scopal hairs are ochraceous and the 
                      thoracic hairs are often reddish colored. Although not a field marker as immobilization of a specimen is needed, the galeae are dull above 
                      due to fine and dense tessellation. The sternal hairs are medially reddish brown and become paler laterally. The wing veins are often 
                      somewhat light in comparison to other Melissodes being red to reddish brown (can however vary widely so not highly diagnostic). The facial 
                      and genal hairs are yellow to pale ochraceous (can look somewhat bright compared to other Melissodes).

                     Although distinctive in Oregon, M. agilis can bear somewhat of a resemblance to a few other M. (Eumelissodes) within the same region.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p style="line-height: 1.5;">
                      ♂ M. agilis superficially resembles a number of other Oregonian Melissodes males, the first of which, as the name implies, 
                      is M. subagilis. This species quite starkly differs from M. agilis in the mandibles and labrum having no maculations 
                      and the galeae which are rather unshagreened and shiny in the apical half (only delicately shagreened if shagreened at 
                      all; sometimes densely tessellated). Another species M. agilis can somewhat resemble is M. menuachus. This species differs 
                      from M. agilis in the shiny or delicately shagreened galeae above (Fig. 14) and the longer first flagellar segment (Fig. 15 in pat; F1 minimum length 
                      about one-fifth of the second segment’s maximum length; M. agilis’ F1 minimum length about one-sixth to one-seventh of the 
                      second segment’s maximum length). M. agilis can appear similar to M. lupinus as well, differing largely in the subgeneric 
                      characteristics (M. lupinus is in M. Callimelissodes and M. agilis is in M. Eumelissodes), such as M. lupinus having a convex margin of the fourth 
                      sternum and M. agilis having a transverse margin (Fig. 16), but also differing in 
                      F5-F9 having longitudinal depressions on the outer surface in M. lupinus, and none in M. agilis (Fig. 17). This 
                      is not to say that all other Oregonian Melissodes males bear no resemblance to males of M. agilis, this is just a comparison 
                      of species that bear the highest resemblance.

                      ♀ M. agilis can superficially resemble M. robustior due to the shared ochraceous vestiture. Thy can be easily distinguished 
                      from one another by the absence of a dark posteromedial mesoscutal patch of hairs on M. agilis, and a presence of one on M. 
                      robustior. If the mesoscutal hairs are absent due to wear, the two can also reliably be separated by the absence of dark tegular 
                      hairs on M. agilis, and the presence of them on M. robustior. If tegular hairs are also absent, M. robustior’s apical impunctate 
                      area of the first tergum extends basally on both sides creating somewhat indistinct lateral rounded projections while M. agilis 
                      has basal punctures that extend to the apical area at extreme lateral areas.

                    <p style="line-height: 1.5;">
                     M. agilis is a known oligolege of the tribes Astereae and Heliantheae (Robertson, 1926), and according to the flower records 
                     presented by Laberge (1961) and from more recent reports in literature (see Hogland, 2025a for entire records with updated 
                     synonymy), M. agilis seems to have a strong preference toward the genus Helianthus. According to Laberge (1961), of the 2,153 M. 
                     agilis collected with floral accounts, 1,608 were found atop Helianthus. This renders Helianthus to be favored 74.69% of the time 
                     by M. agilis.

                  <p style="line-height: 1.5;">
                     Melissodes ablusus is very rare (hence the lack of a common name) with only a single collection from Oregon (DeBano et al., 2024). Before this 
                     state record from Wallowa County (Zumwalt, Oregon), it was believed that M. ablusus only occurred in California (Laberge, 1961), and Utah based on 
                     a 2014 capture (Brigham Young University, Arthropod Collection, 2025). Although only collected in the Northeastern area of Oregon, due to its coastal 
                     presence in California (Laberge, 1961), it seems likely that this species ranges across the entire state. Something of note, M. ablusus was originally 
                     described from one female as a race of M. metenuus that resides in California (Cockerell, 1962). This is interesting as M. metenuus is a known 
                     inhabitant of Oregon, and therefore, it is possible that the singular report of M. ablusus in this region (which is quite a large northward range 
                     expansion), may in fact be a misidentification of M. metenuus. However, given the key-breaks between M. ablusus and M. metenuus for both sexes (the 
                     sex of the M. ablusus specimen from (DeBano et al., 2024) was not given) from Laberge (1961), the likely source in which the Oregonian specimen was 
                     identified, misidentification between the two seems unlikely. As can be determined from above, females of M. ablusus are similar to that of M. metenuus, 
                     but also resemble M. plumosus. Males seem to be similar to that of M. clarkiae based on antennal and flagella structure and, as the males of M. clarkiae 
                     are allied with M. metenuus and M. plumosus, it seems as if the males of M. ablusus may be as well. Given the original description presented by Cockerell 
                     (1926) was only based on a singular female and no males, descriptions from that of Laberge (1961) regarding males of M. ablusus are purely based on 
                     morphological characters, and are therefore tentative. With how few collections there are in general, and only a singular collection in Oregon, a map 
                     and phenology chart will be omitted.

                    <p style="line-height: 1.5;">Due to both the sexual dimorphism and the female dimorphism, three separate treatments will be 
                      listed in this section, (1) males, (2) dark females, (3) light females.</p>
                    <p style="line-height: 1.5;">
                      ♂ The flagella are orange-red and distinct longitudinal depressions laterally on F4-F10 (usually on F3 and F11 as well). The penultimate flagellar segment’s length 
                      is two times its width or less and the galeae are densely tessellated. The first flagellar segment’s minimum length is less than one-fifth of the second 
                      segment’s maximum length and the fourth sternum’s posterior apical area is widely convex. Terga 2-5 are opaque brown and occasionally translucent and yellowish 
                      apically and the mandibular bases are cream colored (almost as pale as the labrum). The apical margin of the broad flap on the fourth sternum is not emarginate 
                      medially (this would count as weakly medially emarginate on the second couplet), and sterna 3 and 5 are distinctly convex apically. Somewhat pale in vestiture, 
                      with the sixth and seventh terga having brown hairs (not black like M. communis and M. tepidus).
<br> <br>

                      ♀ (Dark) The darker females have densely tessellated galeae and measure to be around 9-11 mm. in length. The head hairs are entirely black and the 
                      thorax is a dark brown except for sparse pale-ish brown to ochraceous hairs that surround the base of the wing (these sparse pale-ish brown to ochraceous 
                      hairs are also present dorsally on the metanotum and propodeum). The first tergum’s crowded basal punctures usually extend to the basal half medially and, 
                      in the medial one-third, these punctures are mostly separated by one puncture width or less; minimally basally and sometimes more. The scopae are mostly 
                      yellow to white, only brown near the basitibial plate as well as the apical areas of the basitarsi, and the ultimate flagellar segment is noticeably longer 
                      than it is wide. Terga 2-4 have pale pubescent bands, descriptions of which follow: the basal zone of the second tergum has wide oblique fasciae of pale 
                      pubescence present laterally that can sometimes almost meet medially and reach the apical margin laterally, if this is the case, then the fasciae is dark 
                      brown apicolaterally and medially; The third tergum’s distal pale pubescent band is medially brown and separated from the apical margin by dark brown pubescence 
                      and suberect hairs; the fourth tergum’s apical pubescent band is often dark brown, and occasionally pale brown laterally (only laterally, never medially). 
                      Terga five and six have no lateral pale hairs.
<br><br>

                      ♀ (Light) The lighter females have densely tessellated galeae and measure to be around 9-11 mm. in length (similar to that of the darker females). 
                      The head hairs are usually pale apart from the abundant darker vertex hairs. The hairs on the inner surface of the hind bastitarsi and tibiae are 
                      usually pale-colored red to yellow (if the head hairs and hairs on the inner surface of the hind bastitarsi and tibiae are mostly dark, then the 
                      galeae are always dull; if not, check M. metennus). The thoracic hairs tend to be ochraceous to pale ochraceous, apart from the mesoscutum, which 
                      has a large dark brown patch of hair posteromedially that usually reaches forward to the anterior margins of the tegulae, and the scutellum, which 
                      has a large dark brown medial patch of hair. Terga 2-4 have pale pubescent bands, descriptions of which follow: the second tergum’s basal zone has 
                      long pale ochraceous pubescence and the interband zone has short and relatively simple suberect dark brown to dark ochraceous hairs; the distal, 
                      pale pubescent band of the second tergum is wide and arched  (the band is narrowly interrupted medially and reaches or almost reaches the apex of 
                      the tergum laterally); the apical area of the second tergum has short and simple appressed to suberect, brownish ochraceous hairs, apart from the 
                      narrow glabrous margin; the third tergum is similar to that of the second, but the interband zone often has sparse, appressed, pale pubescence, and 
                      the pale distal band is broader, narrowly interrupted medially, and extends to the apical margin laterally; the medial area of the fourth tergum has 
                      a narrow dark pubescent area along the apical margin, and the broad, pale, pubescent band has scattered brown pubescence (the band is located basally 
                      from the narrow dark pubescent area); terga 5 and 6 have dark brown hairs (tergum 5 has small lateral pale tufts). The first tergum’s crowded basal 
                      punctures usually extend to the basal half medially and, in the medial one-third, these punctures are mostly separated by one puncture width or less; 
                      minimally basally and sometimes more.

<p style="line-height: 1.5;">
                     Melissodes bimatris, the mothered long-horn bee, is incredibly variable in the female sex. As seen in the group-name statement, M. 
                     bimatris females can take a dark or light form (Fig. 20; males aren’t nearly as variable). This species is somewhat uncommon across 
                     its entire range, and it seems similarly so in Oregon with only 12 publicly documented occurrences placing it 14th most common in the 
                     genus (see Fig. 13). Males of M. bimaris resemble M. semilupinus and, depending on which morph, females can either resemble M. 
                     bicoloratus and M. nigracuada (dark), or M. semilupinus (light). Although not documented across the entirety of Oregon, with the 
                     most westward collection occurring in Klamath county (Fig. ??; McElrath, 2023), it seems likely, given its coastal presence in 
                     California (Laberge, 1961), that M. bimatris’ range overlaps the entire state. This species seems to be active from May to November, but most chiefly so in September (see Fig. ??).

                    <p style="line-height: 1.5;">Due to both the sexual dimorphism and the female dimorphism, three separate treatments will be 
                      listed in this section, (1) males, (2) dark females, (3) light females.</p>
                    <p style="line-height: 1.5;">
                      ♂ The flagella are usually reddish-orange ventrally and darker dorsally and the mandibles as well as the labrum often 
                      lack maculations (labrum is usually entirely dark, but sometimes there is a small mediobasal pale macula; mandibles 
                      always lack maculations). In general (when unworn) a very setaceous bee compared to others in the genus, likely appearing 
                      this way due to the dense apical pubescent band covering the apical margin on the first tergum. The tergal apical margins 
                      are transparent to hyaline (first tergum's apical margin cannot be seen due to the aforementioned band) and the clypeus is 
                      entirely yellow except for the tentinoral depressions (black) and apical margin (often piceous). The first flagellar 
                      segment’s maximum length is more than one-third of the third segment’s minimum length. The first flagellar segment’s 
                      minimum length is around one-fifth of the second segment’s maximum length, or less. Often quite pale in vestiture, similar 
                      to that of M. agilis, but does range to paler ochraceous colors as well, with darker hairs on the dorsal areas of the head 
                      (vertex) and thorax. The eyes are often green.<br> <br>

                      ♀ (Dark) The vestiture is almost completely dark apart from the pale ochraceous to near-yellow dorsal thoracic hairs 
                      (sometimes these hairs occur the base of T2 and T1) and bright ochraceous to fluvo-ochraceous scopal hairs except for 
                      the inner surfaces of the hind basitarsi which have dark hairs. The eyes are usually blue (not always) and the mesoscutum doesn’t 
                      have a dark brown to black patch of posteromedial hairs, or if so, then very few dark hairs are present. The first tergum’s 
                      apical impunctate area is medially equal to, or less than, one-half of the punctate basal area. The galeae are shiny and the 
                      mesoscutum is shiny without shagreening.<br><br>

                      ♀ (Light) The general vestiture is mostly white to pale ochraceous with darker ochraceous hairs on the dorsal thoracic and head (vertex) areas. 
                      The first tergum’s apical impunctate area is medially equal to, or less than, one-half of the punctate basal area. The apical areas 
                      of the second and third tergum have long, pale, suberect hairs and the mesoscutum doesn’t have a patch of dark brown to black 
                      posteromedial hairs (if patch present, then composed of very few dark hairs). The hairs on the legs (excluding scopae) are mostly 
                      pale ochraceous to white, apart from the outer apical area of the fore tibiae and middle tibiae, the fore tarsi, and inner 
                      surfaces of the hind basitarsi, which are dark reddish brown to brown. The scopal hairs are sometimes pale ochraceous but often 
                      pale yellow and notably long. The galeae are shiny and the mesoscutum is shiny without shagreening. The flagella are usually 
                      entirely black without red ventral markings and the second flagellar segment

                    <p style="line-height: 1.5;">
                     While highly distinctive within the males due to the dense hair band obscuring the apical margin of the first tergum along with 
                     the lack of mandibular maculations (lack of mandibular maculations separating it from that of M. semilupinus), and the dark females 
                     are distinctive due to the fluvo-ochraceous scopae, lighter forms of the females have an incredibly high resemblance to M. semilupinus. 
                     Similar to the field marks above, due to both the sexual dimorphism and the female dimorphism, three separate similar species comparisons 
                     will be listed in this section, (1) males (2) dark females (3) light females.

                     <p style="line-height: 1.5;">
                     ♂ Males of M. bimatris are analogous to that of M. semilupinus (as stated above), mostly so due to the apical band across the second 
                     tergum (Fig. 22). However, the two can be quite reliably and easily separated from one another by the lack of mandibular maculations on M. bimatris 
                     and the presence of them on M. semilupinus (Fig. 23). Due to these distinctive characters, no other Melissodes, except for M. semilupinus, directly 
                     resemble M. bimatris (apart from similar vestiture coloration).</p>

<p style="line-height: 1.5;">
                     ♀ (Dark) The darker females of M. bimatris are quite distinctive and easily recognisable due to their melanistic vestiture in contrast to their light dorsal thoracic hairs. Out of the entire genus, only two other 
                     Melissodes share this same coloration, those being M. bicoloratus and M. nigracauda. Interestingly, neither have currently been 
                     collected in Oregon, but both have been recently collected in Washington (Ikerd & Engler, 2023; Washington State Department of Agriculture, 
                     2025), a range-expansion that includes parts, and most of, Oregon (see respective species treatments for more information). For this reason, 
                     these two species will be included within this comparison. M. bimatris is distinct and easily told apart from both M. bicoloratus and M. 
                     nigracauda by the light scopal hairs in contrast to the dark, almost nearing black, scopal hairs of M. bicoloratus and M. nigracauda (Fig. 24). 
                     M. bimatris also differs from that of M. nigracauda by the shiny galeae in contrast to the shagreened and dulled galeae of M. nigracauda (M. 
                     bicoloratus also have shiny galeae, and therefore, this character cannot be used in comparison between the two).</p>

                     ♀ (Light) The light form of the females of M. bimatris are quite similar to that of M. ochreus and M. semilupinus, M. ochreus will be omitted 
                     as their current known range doesn't include or overlap Oregon, but comparisons will be made for M. semilupinus. The most notable difference between M. 
                     bimatris and M. semilupinus is the second flagellar segment's length. In M. semilupinus, the length of the second flagellar segment is faintly, but noticeably 
                     longer than its width, whereas in M. bimatris, the length of the second flagellar segment is less than, or equal to, its width.

                    <p style="line-height: 1.5;">
M. bimatris is a known oligolect of Asteraceae (as are almost all Melissodes) but seems to specifically prefer the genus Chrysothamnus (Laberge, 1961). As 
Laberge (1961) presented, of the 72 M. bimatris collected with floral accounts, 53 were found atop Chrysothamnus. This renders Chrysothamnus to be favored 
73.61% of the time by M. bimatris.

<div class="glossary">
  <div class="left" id="text"><b>Scape</b>: the first segment of an antennae.<br><br>
<b>Pedicel</b>: the second segment of an antennae, in Melissodes, these are often very short.<br><br>
<b>Flagellum/flagellomeres</b>: all antennal segments except for the scape and pedicel.<br><br>
<b>Flagellar segment</b>: one of the segments of the flagellum.<br><br>
<b>Sclerite</b> (something having the property of a sclerite, sclerotized): a hardened pale of an insect, referring to a portion of the exoskeleton.<br><br>
<b>Clypeus</b> (plural, clypei; in reference to, clypeal): a large facial sclerite that is somewhat equivalent to the beginning of the nose to the beginning of the lip area on humans.<br><br>
<b>Labrum</b> (in reference to, labral): a medium sized facial sclerite that is smaller than the clypeus and often tucked under the clypeus unless the galeae are extended.<br><br>
<b>Galea</b> (plural, galeae; in reference to, galeal): the outer covering of the tongue.<br><br>
<b>Oculoclypeal distance</b>: the distance between the lateral area of the clypeus and the inner margin of the eye just above the mandibles.<br><br>
<b>Supraclypeal area</b>: the facial sclerite located right above the clypeus.<br><br>
<b>Vertex</b>: the top portion of the head between the apices of the compound eyes.<br><br>
<b>Postocular area</b>: the exoskeletal area behind and lateral to the compound eyes (genal area).<br><br>
<b>Mesoscutum</b> (in reference to, mesoscutal): the large dorsal thoracic plate; when looking at the dorsum of the thorax, this is the anterior plate.<br><br>
<b>Scutellum</b> (in reference to, scutellar): the medium to smaller sized dorsal thoracic plate; when looking at the dorsum of the thorax, this is the posterior plate.<br><br>
<b>Metanotum</b> (in reference to, metanotal): the small dorsal thoracic plate located just posteriorly to the scutellum, but anteriorly to the dorsum of the propodeum.<br><br></div>
  <div class="right" id="text"><b>Propodeum</b> (in reference to, propodeal): the posterior most thoracic segment that’s fused to the first tergum.<br><br>
<b>Tegula</b> (plural, tegulae; in reference to, tegular): a small sclerite covering the base of the forewing.<br><br>
<b>Pronotum</b> (in reference to, pronotal): the anterior most thoracic segment.<br><br>
<b>Mesepisternum</b> (plural, mesepisterna; in reference to, mesepisternal): the lateral portions of the thorax not including the lateral areas of the propodeum or pronotum.<br><br>
<b>Mesopleura</b> (in reference to, mesopleural): the lateral area of the thorax including the lateral areas of the propodeum and pronotum.<br><br>
<b>Mesonotum</b> (in reference to, mesonotal): entirety of the dorsum of the thorax.<br><br>
<b>Metasoma</b> (in reference to, metasomal): the posterior most body segment (abdomen).<br><br>
<b>Tergum</b> (plural, terga; in reference to, tergal): the dorsal surface of the metasoma, however, used as meaning each segment or tergite and reference to the dorsum of the metasoma will be stated clearly.<br><br>
<b>Sternum</b> (plural, sterna; in reference to, sternal): a ventral metasomal segment (i.e. the “other side” of a tergum).<br><br>
<b>Pygidial plate</b>: a small sclerotized plate on the posterior portion of the metasoma usually forming a sort of pointed process.<br><br>
<b>Tibia</b> (plural, tibiae; in reference to, tibial): the second major segment of the legs.<br><br>
<b>Basitibial plate</b>: a small sclerotized plate located at the base of a tibia somewhat resembling a kneecap.<br><br>
<b>Tarsus</b> (plural, tarsi; in reference to, tarsal): the third major segment of the legs composed of the bastitarsus, mediotarsus and distitarsi. However, the bastitarsus is referred to separately from the rest of the tarsi in this guide.<br><br>
<b>Bastitarsus</b> (plural, bastitarsi; in reference to, bastitarsal): the largest and basal most tarsal segment.<br><br>
<b>Scopa</b> (plural, scopae; in reference to, scopal): large pollen collecting hairs. On female Melissodes, these are on the hind tibiae and bastitarsi.<br><br></div>
