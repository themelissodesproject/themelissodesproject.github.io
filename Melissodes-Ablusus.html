                    <p style="line-height: 1.5;">Melissodes ablusus Cockerell is a rare species of Nearctic bee, currently having only 17 
                      publicly documented occurrences, 15 of which are preserved specimens (GBIF Secretariat, 2023), and 2 of which are 
                      wild (DeBano et al., 2024; Wilson et al., 2025). Melissodes species are colloquially referred to as “long-horned bees.” 
                      Because of its rarity, M. ablusus has no common name, and therefore inherits the genus level common name. 
                      Like all Melissodes, male M. ablusus have long antennae, and the females have short antennae in comparison 
                      (see “Genus Melissodes” page for more information). This species resides in the subgenus M. (Callimelissodes) 
                      Laberge along with 14 other species and there are currently no records of a subspecies of M. ablusus 
                      (Laberge, 1961). The two sexes differ in both antennal length and scopal hair density, although when 
                      first described Cockerell didn’t include any male descriptions. All the male identifications and 
                      descriptions are based on structure and color; none of the males found were with females (Laberge, 1961).</p>

                        Melissodes ablusus are medium sized setacouse bees. Females range from 9 to 11 millimeters in length and 
                        3.5 to 4 millimeters in width. Males are a bit smaller, only being about 10 millimeters in length and 3 millimeters 
                        in width with little variation.  The female's first flagellar segment is on average 2.12 times the size of the second 
                        flagellar segment (standard deviation 0.042). The males are the opposite where the second flagellar segment is on 
                        average 4.57 times the size of the first flagellar segment. Female wing length is 2.73 millimeters on average 
                        (standard deviation 0.199 millimeters), and male wing length is 5.19 millimeters on average. Females have an average 
                        of 11.22 hamuli (standard deviation 0.223), while males have an average of 11 (Laberge, 1961).

                      The integument shares the same color as M. lupinus (black), differing at the eyes which are a green to yellowish 
                      green, the wing membranes which are slightly clouded with a brownish black color, and the tibial spurs that can 
                      appear yellow to a reddish brown. The clypeus has small crowded punctures that are often round and separated by 
                      less than half the diameter of a puncture. However, at the base of the clypeus the punctures are slightly 
                      further apart. The surface of the clypeus is dulled by irregular shagreening and does not have a well-defined 
                      boss or median carina apically. The supraclypeal area is shiny and smooth with no shagreening. The flattened 
                      lateral areas of the vertex near the apices of both compound eyes are moderately shiny and have small round 
                      punctures mostly separated by less than half the diameter of a puncture with sparse shagreening. The last 
                      flagellar segment is distinctly longer than broad and is rounded distally. The eyes in the facial view are slightly 
                      less than three times as long as they are wide, and converge strongly toward the mandibles. The four maxillary 
                      palpal segments decrease in length from basal to apical in a ratio of about 6:5:5:1. The galeae is narrow and 
                      has an opaque surface that is dulled by dense coarse tessellation. The mesoscutum has a large posteromedian area 
                      that is impunctate. This area is about one third of the total mesoscutum surface, and the punctures that 
                      surround the impunctate area are small. Posteromedially, the surface is shiny, but tends to be dulled anteriorly 
                      and laterally by fine shagreening. Punctures of the scutellum are sparse medially, and often separated by 
                      more than one puncture diameter; the surface is dulled by fine shagreening. The metanotum is shiny and opaque 
                      medially and has abundant round punctures that are noticeably smaller than those of the mesoscutum. 
                      The punctures are mostly separated by half the diameter of a puncture or less and the surface of the non-medial 
                      metanotum is opaque and dulled by delicate and fine tessellation. The mesepisternum has a lateral surface 
                      with punctures that are smaller than that of the mesoscutum. The punctures of the mesepisternum’s lateral 
                      surface are crowded and separated by half a puncture diameter or less. The surface is moderately shiny to 
                      dull with shagreening. The propodeum’s dorsal surface is reticulorugose except medially and is posteriorly 
                      rugae. The ruga often assume the aspect of discrete large punctures. The propodeum’s posterior surface has 
                      distinct round punctures that are separated by one-half to one diameter of a puncture, except the impunctate
                       upper median triangular area. The lateral surfaces of the propodeum are opaque,  have crowded punctures, 
                       and are dulled by fine, delicate tessellation (Laberge, 1961).

                    <p style="line-height: 1.5;">
                      The first metasomal tergum’s integument basal half is moderately shiny to shiny with very fine reticulotransverse 
                      shagreening, and crowded with shallow punctures. The second tergum’s interband zone has deep, round, regular 
                      punctures that are separated by one-half to half a puncture diameter. The apical area of the second tergum 
                      has abundant punctures that are deep and round, mostly separated by one-half to half a puncture diameter 
                      except for the narrow apical impunctate area. Integument of the second tergum is shiny with very fine reticulotransverse 
                      shagreening. Both tergum 3 and 4 are similar to tergum 2, although the apical area is obscured by distal 
                      pubescence. The pygidial plate is narrow, U-shaped, and its sides are subparallel in the apical half (Laberge, 1961).
                    </p>

                    <p style="line-height: 1.5;">
                      M. ablusus can vary in setal coloration; the two extremes are as follows. The darkest specimen has an all-black head. 
                      The thorax is a dark brown except for sparse pale-ish brown to ochraceous hairs that surround the base of the wing. 
                      These sparse pale-ish brown to ochraceous hairs are also present dorsally on the metanotum and propodeum. The metasoma 
                      is completely dark brown except for the second tergum’s basal zone which is covered in ocheraceous pubescence. The basal 
                      zone of the second tergum has wide oblique fasciae of pale pubescence present laterally. The fasciae may almost meet
                       medially and can reach the apical margin laterally. However, if this happens, the fasciae is dark brown toward the 
                       middle, and apicolaterally. The third tergum’s distal pale pubescent band is medially brown. The pale pubescence is 
                       separated from the apical margin of tergum three by dark brown pubescence and suberect hairs. The fourth tergum’s 
                       apical pubescent band is dark brown but can be a pale brown laterally. Terga five and six have no lateral pale hairs. 
                       The leg hairs are a dark brown, whereas the scopal hairs are a yellowish white (Laberge, 1961).

                    <p style="line-height: 1.5;">Melissodes ablusus Cockerell is a rare species of Nearctic bee, currently having only 17 
                      publicly documented occurrences, 15 of which are preserved specimens (GBIF Secretariat, 2023), and 2 of which are 
                      wild (DeBano et al., 2024; Wilson et al., 2025). Melissodes species are colloquially referred to as “long-horned bees.” 
                      Because of its rarity, M. ablusus has no common name, and therefore inherits the genus level common name. 
                      Like all Melissodes, male M. ablusus have long antennae, and the females have short antennae in comparison 
                      (see “Genus Melissodes” page for more information). This species resides in the subgenus M. (Callimelissodes) 
                      Laberge along with 14 other species and there are currently no records of a subspecies of M. ablusus 
                      (Laberge, 1961). The two sexes differ in both antennal length and scopal hair density, although when 
                      first described Cockerell didn’t include any male descriptions. All the male identifications and 
                      descriptions are based on structure and color; none of the males found were with females (Laberge, 1961).</p>

                        Melissodes ablusus are medium sized setacouse bees. Females range from 9 to 11 millimeters in length and 
                        3.5 to 4 millimeters in width. Males are a bit smaller, only being about 10 millimeters in length and 3 millimeters 
                        in width with little variation.  The female's first flagellar segment is on average 2.12 times the size of the second 
                        flagellar segment (standard deviation 0.042). The males are the opposite where the second flagellar segment is on 
                        average 4.57 times the size of the first flagellar segment. Female wing length is 2.73 millimeters on average 
                        (standard deviation 0.199 millimeters), and male wing length is 5.19 millimeters on average. Females have an average 
                        of 11.22 hamuli (standard deviation 0.223), while males have an average of 11 (Laberge, 1961).

                      The integument shares the same color as M. lupinus (black), differing at the eyes which are a green to yellowish 
                      green, the wing membranes which are slightly clouded with a brownish black color, and the tibial spurs that can 
                      appear yellow to a reddish brown. The clypeus has small crowded punctures that are often round and separated by 
                      less than half the diameter of a puncture. However, at the base of the clypeus the punctures are slightly 
                      further apart. The surface of the clypeus is dulled by irregular shagreening and does not have a well-defined 
                      boss or median carina apically. The supraclypeal area is shiny and smooth with no shagreening. The flattened 
                      lateral areas of the vertex near the apices of both compound eyes are moderately shiny and have small round 
                      punctures mostly separated by less than half the diameter of a puncture with sparse shagreening. The last 
                      flagellar segment is distinctly longer than broad and is rounded distally. The eyes in the facial view are slightly 
                      less than three times as long as they are wide, and converge strongly toward the mandibles. The four maxillary 
                      palpal segments decrease in length from basal to apical in a ratio of about 6:5:5:1. The galeae is narrow and 
                      has an opaque surface that is dulled by dense coarse tessellation. The mesoscutum has a large posteromedian area 
                      that is impunctate. This area is about one third of the total mesoscutum surface, and the punctures that 
                      surround the impunctate area are small. Posteromedially, the surface is shiny, but tends to be dulled anteriorly 
                      and laterally by fine shagreening. Punctures of the scutellum are sparse medially, and often separated by 
                      more than one puncture diameter; the surface is dulled by fine shagreening. The metanotum is shiny and opaque 
                      medially and has abundant round punctures that are noticeably smaller than those of the mesoscutum. 
                      The punctures are mostly separated by half the diameter of a puncture or less and the surface of the non-medial 
                      metanotum is opaque and dulled by delicate and fine tessellation. The mesepisternum has a lateral surface 
                      with punctures that are smaller than that of the mesoscutum. The punctures of the mesepisternum’s lateral 
                      surface are crowded and separated by half a puncture diameter or less. The surface is moderately shiny to 
                      dull with shagreening. The propodeum’s dorsal surface is reticulorugose except medially and is posteriorly 
                      rugae. The ruga often assume the aspect of discrete large punctures. The propodeum’s posterior surface has 
                      distinct round punctures that are separated by one-half to one diameter of a puncture, except the impunctate
                       upper median triangular area. The lateral surfaces of the propodeum are opaque,  have crowded punctures, 
                       and are dulled by fine, delicate tessellation (Laberge, 1961).

                    <p style="line-height: 1.5;">
                      The first metasomal tergum’s integument basal half is moderately shiny to shiny with very fine reticulotransverse 
                      shagreening, and crowded with shallow punctures. The second tergum’s interband zone has deep, round, regular 
                      punctures that are separated by one-half to half a puncture diameter. The apical area of the second tergum 
                      has abundant punctures that are deep and round, mostly separated by one-half to half a puncture diameter 
                      except for the narrow apical impunctate area. Integument of the second tergum is shiny with very fine reticulotransverse 
                      shagreening. Both tergum 3 and 4 are similar to tergum 2, although the apical area is obscured by distal 
                      pubescence. The pygidial plate is narrow, U-shaped, and its sides are subparallel in the apical half (Laberge, 1961).

                    <p style="line-height: 1.5;">
                      M. ablusus can vary in setal coloration; the two extremes are as follows. The darkest specimen has an all-black head. 
                      The thorax is a dark brown except for sparse pale-ish brown to ochraceous hairs that surround the base of the wing. 
                      These sparse pale-ish brown to ochraceous hairs are also present dorsally on the metanotum and propodeum. The metasoma 
                      is completely dark brown except for the second tergum’s basal zone which is covered in ocheraceous pubescence. The basal 
                      zone of the second tergum has wide oblique fasciae of pale pubescence present laterally. The fasciae may almost meet
                       medially and can reach the apical margin laterally. However, if this happens, the fasciae is dark brown toward the 
                       middle, and apicolaterally. The third tergum’s distal pale pubescent band is medially brown. The pale pubescence is 
                       separated from the apical margin of tergum three by dark brown pubescence and suberect hairs. The fourth tergum’s 
                       apical pubescent band is dark brown but can be a pale brown laterally. Terga five and six have no lateral pale hairs. 
                       The leg hairs are a dark brown, whereas the scopal hairs are a yellowish white (Laberge, 1961).
