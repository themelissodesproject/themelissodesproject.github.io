                    <p style="line-height: 1.5;">Melissodes ablusus Cockerell is a rare species of Nearctic bee, currently having only 17 
                      publicly documented occurrences, all of which are preserved (GBIF Secretariat, 2023; DeBano et al., 2024; Wilson et al., 2025). 
                      Melissodes species are colloquially referred to as “long-horned bees.” 
                      Because of its rarity, M. ablusus has no common name and therefore inherits the genus level common name. 
                      Like all Melissodes, male M. ablusus have long antennae, and the females have short antennae in comparison 
                      (see "Genus" page for more information). This species resides in the subgenus M. (Callimelissodes) 
                      Laberge along with 14 other species. There are currently no records of a subspecies of M. ablusus 
                      (Laberge, 1961). The two sexes differ in both antennal length and scopal hair density, although when 
                      first described Cockerell didn’t include any male descriptions. All the male identifications and 
                      descriptions are based on structure and color; none of the males found were with females (Laberge, 1961).</p>

                    <p style="line-height: 1.5;"> 
                        Based on Laberge's (1961) description, Melissodes ablusus are medium sized setacouse bees. Females range from 9 to 11 millimeters in length and 
                        3.5 to 4 millimeters in width (width measured at the widest portion of the metasoma). Males are a bit smaller, being about 10 millimeters in length and 3 millimeters 
                        in width (width measured at the widest portion of the metasoma). The female's first flagellar segment is on average 2.12 times the size of the second 
                        flagellar segment (standard deviation 0.042). The males are the opposite where the second flagellar segment is on 
                        average 4.57 times the size of the first flagellar segment. Female wing length is 2.73 millimeters on average 
                        (standard deviation 0.199 millimeters), and male wing length is 5.19 millimeters on average. Females have an average 
                        of 11.22 hamuli (standard deviation 0.223), while males have an average of 11.

                      According to Laberge (1961), the integument shares the same color as M. lupinus (black), differing at the eyes which are a green to yellowish 
                      green, the wing membranes which are slightly clouded with a brownish black color, and the tibial spurs that can 
                      appear yellow to a reddish brown. The clypeus has small crowded punctures that are often round and separated by 
                      less than half the diameter of a puncture. However, at the base of the clypeus the punctures are slightly 
                      further apart. The surface of the clypeus is dulled by irregular shagreening and does not have a well-defined 
                      boss or median carina apically. The supraclypeal area is shiny and smooth with no shagreening. The flattened 
                      lateral areas of the vertex near the apices of both compound eyes are moderately shiny and have small round 
                      punctures mostly separated by less than half the diameter of a puncture with sparse shagreening. The last 
                      flagellar segment is distinctly longer than broad and is rounded distally. The eyes in the facial view are slightly 
                      less than three times as long as they are wide, and converge strongly toward the mandibles. The four maxillary 
                      palpal segments decrease in length from basal to apical in a ratio of about 6:5:5:1. The galeae is narrow and 
                      has an opaque surface that is dulled by dense coarse tessellation. The mesoscutum has a large posteromedian area 
                      that is impunctate. This area is about one third of the total mesoscutum surface, and the punctures that 
                      surround the impunctate area are small. Posteromedially, the surface is shiny, but tends to be dulled anteriorly 
                      and laterally by fine shagreening. Punctures of the scutellum are sparse medially, and often separated by 
                      more than one puncture diameter; the surface is dulled by fine shagreening. The metanotum is shiny and opaque 
                      medially and has abundant round punctures that are noticeably smaller than those of the mesoscutum. 
                      The punctures are mostly separated by half the diameter of a puncture or less and the surface of the non-medial 
                      metanotum is opaque and dulled by delicate and fine tessellation. The mesepisternum has a lateral surface 
                      with punctures that are smaller than that of the mesoscutum. The punctures of the mesepisternum’s lateral 
                      surface are crowded and separated by half a puncture diameter or less. The surface is moderately shiny to 
                      dull with shagreening. The propodeum’s dorsal surface is reticulorugose except medially and is posteriorly 
                      rugae. The ruga often assume the aspect of discrete large punctures. The propodeum’s posterior surface has 
                      distinct round punctures that are separated by one-half to one diameter of a puncture, except the impunctate
                       upper median triangular area. The lateral surfaces of the propodeum are opaque,  have crowded punctures, 
                       and are dulled by fine, delicate tessellation.
                    </p>

                      The first metasomal tergum’s integument basal half is moderately shiny to shiny with very fine reticulotransverse 
                      shagreening and is crowded with shallow punctures. The second tergum’s interband zone has deep, round, regular 
                      punctures that are separated by one-half to half a puncture diameter. The apical area of the second tergum 
                      has abundant punctures that are deep and round, mostly separated by one-half to half a puncture diameter 
                      except for the narrow apical impunctate area. Integument of the second tergum is shiny with very fine reticulotransverse 
                      shagreening. Both tergum 3 and 4 are similar to tergum 2, although the apical area is obscured by distal 
                      pubescence. The pygidial plate is narrow, U-shaped, and its sides are subparallel in the apical half.
                    </p>

                    <p style="line-height: 1.5;">
                      M. ablusus can vary in setal coloration; the two extremes are as follows. <b>The darkest specimen</b> has an all-black 
                      head. The thorax is a dark brown except for sparse pale-ish brown to ochraceous hairs that surround the base of 
                      the wing. These sparse pale-ish brown to ochraceous hairs are also present dorsally on the metanotum and 
                      propodeum. The metasoma is completely dark brown except for the second tergum’s basal zone which is covered 
                      in ocheraceous pubescence. The basal zone of the second tergum has wide oblique fasciae of pale pubescence 
                      present laterally. The fasciae may almost meet medially and can reach the apical margin laterally. However, 
                      if this happens, the fasciae is dark brown toward the middle, and apicolaterally. The third tergum’s distal pale 
                      pubescent band is medially brown. The pale pubescence is separated from the apical margin of tergum three by 
                      dark brown pubescence and suberect hairs. The fourth tergum’s apical pubescent band is dark brown but can be 
                      a pale brown laterally. Terga five and six have no lateral pale hairs. The leg hairs are a dark brown, whereas 
                      the scopal hairs are a yellowish white. <b>The palest specimen</b> has a dark brown face mixed with pale ochraceous, 
                      except the clypeus; dark brown on vertex. The face is predominantly brown along the inner margins of the 
                      eyes surrounding the antennal fossa and adjacent supraclypeal area. The thoracic hairs tend to be ochraceous 
                      to pale ochraceous. However, the mesoscutum has a large dark brown patch of hair posteromedially that 
                      extends forward usually to a transverse line at the anterior margins of the tegulae. The scutellum’s median 
                      area has a large dark brown patch of hair. The first tergum has long pale ochraceous hairs both basally 
                      and laterally. The second tergum’s basal zone has long pale ochraceous pubescence. The second tergum’s 
                      interband zone has short and relatively simple suberect dark brown to dark ochraceous hairs. Distal, pale 
                      pubescent band of the second tergum is broad and arched; narrowly interrupted medially and reaches or 
                      almost reaches the apex of the tergum laterally. Tergum two’s apical area has short and simple appressed 
                      to suberect, brownish ochraceous hairs except for a narrow glabrous margin. The third tergum is similar 
                      to the second but the interband zone often has sparse, appressed, pale pubescence. The pale distal band 
                      of the third tergum is broader than that of the second tergum, narrowly interrupted medially, and extends 
                      to the apical margin laterally. The median third of tergum four has a narrow dark pubescent area along 
                      the apical margin. The fourth tergum’s broad, pale, pubescent band has scattered brown pubescence and is 
                      located basally from the narrow dark pubescent area. Terga 5 and 6 have dark brown hairs; tergum 5 has 
                      small lateral pale tufts. The sternal hairs are brown except at extreme apical and lateral margins of 
                      sterna 3, 4, and 5. The legs usually have pale ochraceous to white hairs. The distitarsi is usually brown, 
                      along with the coxae, trochanters, basitibial plates, and femora. The fore and middle tibiae and tarsi 
                      are dark brown except for the outer apical surfaces of the tibiae. The hind tibia and basitari’s inner 
                      surfaces are a dark brown, whereas the middle basitari’s inner surfaces are more of a dark reddish brown. 
                      The scopal hairs are white to ochraceous, and the rachis of each setae do not extend very far beyond 
                      the plumose part. Each hair of the scopa usually has 4 to 6 branches on each side, these only occur on 
                      the apical most half of the rachis, and sometimes less (i.e. further out on the rachis). Two to several 
                      scopal hairs that are on the posterior part of the tibia’s apex are almost sinuous and bent to shape 
                      of the surface of apical glabrous tibial area.

                      According to Laberge (1961), the integument shares the same color as M. lupinus (black), differing at the eyes which are gray; the 
                      flagellum which is yellow to red below (except for the first segment) and dark brown above; the clypeus and 
                      mandibular base which is cream colored (almost as pale as the labrum); the wings which have hyaline membranes 
                      and black to brown veins; terga 2-5 are opaque brown and occasionally translucent and yellowish apically; 
                      the disitarsi are rufescent; and the tibial spurs which are yellow to white. The eyes strongly converge 
                      toward the mandibles, and tend to be about 3/8 as wide as they are long. The minimum length of the first 
                      flagellar segment is less than 1/5 of the maximum length of the second segment. Flagellar segments 3 
                      through 10 (and the base of 11) have ventrolateral shiny longitudinal depressions. The penultimate 
                      flagellar segment is twice as long as it is wide, and the ultimate segment is far less than three times 
                      as long as it is wide. The maxillary palpal segments decrease from basal to apical in a ratio of about 
                      2.2:2.0:2.0:1.0. The apical margin of the broad flap on sternum 4 is not emarginate medially, and sterna 
                      3 and 5 are distinctly convex apically. The remainder of the characteristics are the same as the female 
                      described above except as follows: the punctures on the clypeus are more widely spaced and slightly coarser; 
                      the mesepisternum’s lateral surface is shiny with very sparse shagreening; the first tergum’s basal four-fifths 
                      is dense with regular punctures; terga 2-4 are apically impunctate.

                      The 7th sternum’s median plate is flat and lies in the normal ventral plane, not rotated sideways. 
                      The apicolateral angles of sternum 7 are rounded, the sternum briefly narrows into a short, broad neck, 
                      and has abundant short hairs ventrally. The membranous area between the inner edge of the lateral plate 
                      and the lower part of the median plate is almost completely obscured and appears as a thin line. The 
                      8th sternum usually has one or two hairs apicomedially, and no apical hairs medially. The apicoventral 
                      tubercle of sternum 8 is unidentate, rounded apically, and slightly surpasses the apical margin medially. 
                      The gonostylus is less than two-thirds the length of the gonocoxite and is capitate. The ventral area 
                      of the gonostylus has short sparse hairs near the base, and no hairs laterally. The spatha is sinuate 
                      apically and about three times as wide as it is long. The penis valve’s dorsolateral lamella ends at 
                      the spatha and isn’t turned inward to form a tooth just in front of the spatha.

                      While it’s likely there are wide variations of setal color in male M. ablusus, only one specimen has currently 
                      been described. The head and thorax are pale ochraceous; the dorsum of the thorax is yellowish; the scutellum has 
                      sparse brown hairs medially. The first tergum has long pale ochraceous hairs on the basal four-fifths. The 
                      second tergum has white to pale ochraceous hairs. The basal and distal pubescent bands are white, although the 
                      distal pubescent band is often narrowly interrupted medially. The interband zone has ochraceous suberect hairs, 
                      and the apical areas are glabrous. Tergum 3 is similar to the second tergum, but the basal tomentum is brown and the 
                      distal pubescent band is not interrupted medially. Terga 4 and 5 are similar to tergum 3, but have simple, suberect 
                      apical hairs that are often brown at least medially. The fourth and fifth terga’s distal pale pubescent bands are 
                      not narrowly interrupted and reach the apical margin except medially. Terga 6 and 7 have dark brown hairs. The 
                      sternal hairs are pale ochraceous and usually darkened medially. The leg hairs are white to pale ochraceous, however, 
                      the inner surfaces of basitarsi and usually the distitarsi are often pale rufescent to yellow.

                      M. ablusus have very few documented occurrences in general, let alone with locations documented. From the publicly 
                      available records, and postulates of the subgenus M. (Callimelissodes), there can be an assumed range. 
                      M. (Callimelissodes) as a subgenus mostly resides in the western United States (four species reside east 
                      of the Mississippi). In 1961, Laberge showed that M. ablusus was more widespread across the mid-south 
                      of California, which matches up with the location of the subgenus. Laberge (1961) stated that he examined 
                      3 female paratypes that were collected with the holotype (however Cockerell (1926) mentions 7 female 
                      paratypes collected with the holotype; those will be counted instead of the 3 Laberge mentioned), 6 
                      females collected with the holotype, an additional female collected by E. C. Van Dyke, and one male 
                      collected by R. M. Bohart for a total of 15 occurrences. Only two locations were given; the female 
                      collected by E. C. Van Dyke was at Millbrae, California, and the male collected by R. M. Bohart was 
                      at Bolinas, California (Laberge, 1961). In 2024, a study about restoring pollinator habitat in Oregon 
                      overhauled the aforementioned range by showing sightings of M. ablusus outside of California 
                      (DeBano et al., 2024). Based on the study, M. ablusus was found in Zumwalt, Oregon (Fig. 1). In 2025, a survey of bees in Utah 
                      showed presence of a M. ablusus (Fig. 1) as well (Wilson et al., 2025). No further location has been given 
                      for Utah. There are currently 15 documented occurrences of M. ablusus with a date associated. With that 
                      information, a vague approximation of annual activity can be illustrated (Fig. 2). As of now, there are no 
                      current flower records for M. ablusus.

                      M. ablusus was originally described in 1926 by Cockerell as a race of M. metenuus from Oregon. When first described as a race, M. 
                      ablusus was given no subgenus. In 1961, Laberge introduced the subgenus Callimelissodes which he noted was previously attributed to 
                      Eumelissodes. He included both M. metenuus and M. ablusus in this subgenus. M. ablusus got re-assigned from race to species in 1961 
                      because of the opaque, dulled, rough textured surface of the galeae in contrast to the shiny, relatively non-shagreened surface of 
                      M. metenuus. Another distinction made was in the maxillary palpi in which M. ablusus females have a segment ratio of 6:5:5:1 whereas  
                      M. metenuus females have a segment ratio of 2.3:2.3:2.0:1.0 and occasionally a fifth minute segment (Laberge, 1961).
