                    <p style="line-height: 1.5;">Melissodes agilis Cresson, the agile long-horned bee, is by far the most abundant 
                      North American species of Melissodes (Laberge, 1961). Like all Melissodes, male M. ablusus have long 
                      antennae, and the females have short antennae in comparison (see “Genus Melissodes” page for more information). 
                      This species resides in, and is the type species of, the subgenus M. (Eumelissodes) Laberge. Both sexes of 
                      M. agilis can resemble other species in M. (Eumelissodes) Laberge, although the females can be somewhat easily 
                      distinguished by their red thoracic hairs, red to reddish brown wing veins, dulled galea, and ochraceous 
                      scopal hairs. Males can be distinguished from that of other M. (Eumelissodes) Laberge by their dulled galea, 
                      yellow maculate on mandibles and labrum, entirely yellow clypeaus, short first flagellar segment, pale ochraceous 
                      to red thoracic hairs, and hyaline tergal margins (see “Description and Identification” for more information on 
                      both sexes) (Laberge, 1961). M. agilis is seemingly an oligolege of the tribes Astereae and Heliantheae 
                      (Robertson, 1926), however, recent studies have shown that M. agilis was also a prolific pollinator of soybeans 
                      (Wheelock, 2014).</p>

                        Melissodes agilis are medium sized setacouse bees. Females range from 10 to 13 millimeters in length and 3.5 to 
                        4.5 millimeters in width. Males are a bit smaller, only being about 9 to 12 millimeters in length and 3 to 4 
                        millimeters in width. The female's first flagellar segment is on average 1.81 times the size of the second flagellar 
                        segment (standard deviation 0.027). The males are the opposite where the second flagellar segment is on average 
                        7.37 times the size of the first flagellar segment (standard deviation 0.164). Female wing length is 3.46 millimeters 
                        on average (standard deviation 0.159 millimeters), and male wing length is 3.20 millimeters on average 
                        (standard deviation 0.217 millimeters). Females have an average of 13.45 hamuli (standard deviation 0.223), 
                        while males have an average of 11.65 (standard deviation 0.274) (Laberge, 1961).

                      The integument is black, differing at the eyes which are a gray to bluish gray and rarely greenish or black with violet 
                      reflection; the wing membranes which are completely hyaline; the wing veins which are red to reddish brown; the apical half 
                      of the mandibles which are rufescent; the underside of flagellar segments 3-10 and often the apex of the second which are 
                      rufescent; the distitarsi which is also rufescent; the pterostigma which is yellow to red, and the tibial spurs that can 
                      appear yellow to a red. The clypeus has small regular punctures that are often round and separated by one to half the diameter 
                      of a puncture. The surface of the clypeus is dulled by coarse and regular reticular shagreening and often has a short median 
                      horizontal carina in the apical half. The clypeus slightly protrudes beyond the eyes in profile view, but by no more than half 
                      an eye’s width. The supraclypeal area is similar to that of the clypeus, but it’s often impunctate medially. The galeae is 
                      dulled above by dense and fine tessellation. The four maxillary palpal segments decrease in length from basal to apical in a 
                      ratio of about 4.5:3.5:3.3:1.0. The flattened lateral areas of the vertex have small round punctures that are separated on 
                      average by one to three diameters of a puncture. The surface of the vertex is dulled by irregular reticular shagreening. The 
                      mesoscutum is shiny and sparsely or not at all shagreened and has deep round punctures that are separated by one to half the 
                      diameter of a puncture. The large posteromedian area of the mesoscutum has punctures that tend to be slightly larger and more 
                      sparse. Punctures of the scutellum are similar to the punctures on the mesoscutum, but they are slightly more crowded. The 
                      metanotum is dulled by very fine reticular shagreening, and has punctures that are half the diameter of the punctures on the 
                      scutellum. The punctures are mostly separated by one to half the diameter of a puncture. The propodeum’s dorsal surface is 
                      reticulorugose and is especially coarse basally, and the posterior surface has coarse punctures except for the upper triangle. 
                      The lateral surfaces of the propodeum are similar to the posterior surface but the punctures are more crowded and the surfaces 
                      are dulled by dense regular tessellation. The mesepisternum’s lateral surface has punctures that are large, shallow, and 
                      separated mostly by half a puncture diameter or less. The surface is shiny and unshagreened or if so then finely 
                      (Laberge, 1961).

                      The first metasomal tergum’s basal three-fifths is dulled by fine tessellation and is slightly less punctate. The punctures 
                      are round, shallow, and separated mostly by one to two puncture diameters; punctures can extend to the apex at extreme sides. 
                      The apical area of the first tergum is impunctate with a shiny surface that is extremely finely reticulotransversely 
                      shagreened. The second tergum’s basal zone is shiny but has fine reticular shagreening and tiny round punctures that are 
                      separated by one to half a puncture diameter. The interband zone of the second tergum is dulled by reticulotransverse 
                      shagreening and has small irregular punctures that are separated by one to three puncture diameters; these punctures are 
                      sparser medially than in the lateral raised areas. The apical area of the second tergum has a moderately shiny surface 
                      that is dulled with fine reticulotransverse shagreening and is impunctate or if punctate then it has minute punctures that 
                      are no wider than the base of the hairs that arise from them. Each of these punctures are separated by two to four puncture 
                      diameters. Both terga 3 and 4 are similar to tergum 2, but the punctures of the interband zone are relatively more distinct 
                      and abundant, the apical zone is also smaller or absent. The pygidial plate is broadly, V-shaped, with a rounded apex (Laberge, 1961).

                    <p style="line-height: 1.5;">
                      M. agilis has a somewhat small range of setal variation, the most common description of which follows. Facial and genal area 
                      hairs are pale ochraceous to yellow and the vertex is yellow to bright rufescent (the vertex will sometimes have brown hairs, 
                      if so, they are never abundant). The sides of the thorax are pale ochraceous, and the top is ochraceous to bright rufescent. 
                      The first tergum has long, ochraceous to yellow or slightly rufescent hairs basally and laterally, except for the apical area 
                      which is glabrous or has very sparse, small, appressed brown to yellow hairs basally and laterally. The second tergum’s white 
                      to yellow basal pubescent band is long and the interband zone has short, appressed to subappressed, relatively simple, white 
                      to pale hairs. The distal pale band of the second tergum is yellow to white, broad laterally (very rarely reaching apical 
                      margin) to narrow medially, and usually it’s narrowly interrupted medially. The apical area of the second tergum has relatively 
                      simple, appressed to subappressed, white to yellow hairs that obscure the surface, be it not entirely. The third tergum is 
                      similar to the second but the basal tomentum is dark brown as well as the hairs on the interband zone, the distal pale band 
                      isn’t interrupted, and the apical area is shorter. The fourth tergum is similar to the third, but the pale distal pubescent 
                      band reaches the apex across the entire tergum and occasionally has a minute apicomedial area of brown hairs. Terga 5 and 6 
                      are dark brown except for white to yellow tufts of hair at extreme sides. The sterna is pale reddish brown at extreme sides, 
                      and darker reddish brown medially. The legs are pale white to yellow except for the fore tarsi and often middle basitarsi on 
                      their outer surfaces, which is brown; the fore and middle tibiae on the outer surfaces near the apices, which are brown; The 
                      apices of the outer surfaces of the hind basitarsi and often the areas on and surrounding the basitibial plates, which are brown; 
                      the inner surfaces of the hind basitarsi, which are red to reddish brown; and the scopal hairs, which are ochraceous to yellow 
                      (Laberge, 1961).
                    </p>

                    <p style="line-height: 1.5;">
                      The integument is black, differing at the eyes which are green to grey or greyish blue; the wing membranes, 
                      which are completely hyaline; the wing veins, which are yellow; the base of the mandibles, which are yellow 
                      to cream colored; the labrum, which is white or cream-colored and the apical margin of the labrum, which is 
                      brown, very rarely all brown; the flagellum, which is red to yellow below and dark red to brown above; the 
                      distitarsi, which is rufescent; the tegulae, which is usually testaceous and sometimes piceous; the apical 
                      margins of the terga, which are hyaline and colorless to yellow, although in some eastern individuals, it 
                      can be a translucent brown; and the tibial spurs that can appear yellow to white. The clypeus protrudes beyond 
                      the eye by about half the width of an eye in profile view. The first flagellar segment is about one-sixth to 
                      one-seventh the maximum length of the second segment (as stated above), and the penultimate segment is about 
                      three times as long (maximum) as it is wide (minimum). All flagellar segments do not have longitudinal lateral 
                      depressions. The four maxillary palpal segments decrease in length from basal to apical in a ratio of about 
                      4:3:3:1. The remainder of the characteristics are the same as the female described above except as follows: 
                      the clypeus’ short surface is often moderately shiny; the mesepisternum’s surface is usually somewhat dulled 
                      by fine and irregular shagreening; the medial portion of the first tergum’s basal four-fifths to five-sixths 
                      has small punctures that are separated by one to three puncture diameters; the interband zone of terga 2 and 
                      3’s surface is moderately shiny with reticular shagreening, and has slightly larger and more abundant 
                      punctures; the hyaline apical areas of terga 1 through 5 are shiny to moderately shiny with extremely fine 
                      reticulotransverse shagreening; the sterna’s surfaces are shiny to moderately shiny and usually have distinct 
                      regular reticular shagreening (Laberge, 1961).

                      The 7th sternum’s median plate is flat and lies in the normal ventral plane, not rotated sideways. 
                      The apicolateral angles of sternum 7 are rounded, the sternum briefly narrows into a short, broad neck, 
                      and has abundant short hairs ventrally. The membranous area between the inner edge of the lateral plate 
                      and the lower part of the median plate is almost completely obscured and appears as a thin line. The 
                      8th sternum usually has one or two hairs apicomedially, and no apical hairs medially. The apicoventral 
                      tubercle of sternum 8 is unidentate, rounded apically, and slightly surpasses the apical margin medially. 
                      The gonostylus is less than two-thirds the length of the gonocoxite and is capitate. The ventral area 
                      of the gonostylus has short sparse hairs near the base, and no hairs laterally. The spatha is sinuate 
                      apically and about three times as wide as it is long. The penis valve’s dorsolateral lamella ends at 
                      the spatha and isn’t turned inward to form a tooth just in front of the spatha (Laberge, 1961).

                      While it’s likely there are wide variations of setal color in male M. ablusus, only one specimen has currently 
                      been described. The head and thorax are pale ochraceous; the dorsum of the thorax is yellowish; the scutellum has 
                      sparse brown hairs medially. The first tergum has long pale ochraceous hairs on the basal four-fifths. The 
                      second tergum has white to pale ochraceous hairs. The basal and distal pubescent bands are white, although the 
                      distal pubescent band is often narrowly interrupted medially. The interband zone has ochraceous suberect hairs, 
                      and the apical areas are glabrous. Tergum 3 is similar to the second terga, but the basal tomentum is brown, the 
                      distal pubescent band is not interrupted medially. Terga 4 and 5 are similar to tergum 3, but have simple, suberect 
                      apical hairs that are often brown at least medially. The fourth and fifth terga’s distal pale pubescent bands are 
                      not narrowly interrupted and reach the apical margin except medially. Terga 6 and 7 have dark brown hairs. The 
                      sternal hairs are pale ochraceous and usually darkened medially. The leg hairs are white to pale ochraceous, however, 
                      the inner surfaces of basitarsi and usually the distitarsi are often pale rufescent to yellow (Laberge, 1961).

                      M. ablusus have very few documented occurrences in general, let alone from the wild. From the publicly 
                      available records, and postulates of the subgenus M. (Callimelissodes), there can be an assumed range. 
                      M. (Callimelissodes) as a subgenus mostly resides in the western United States (four species reside east 
                      of the Mississippi). In 1961, Laberge showed that M. ablusus was more widespread across the mid-south 
                      of California, which matches up with the location of the subgenus. Laberge (1961) stated that he examined 
                      3 female paratypes that were collected with the holotype (however Cockerell (1926) mentions 7 female 
                      paratypes collected with the holotype; those will be counted instead of the 3 Laberge mentioned), 6 
                      females collected with the holotype, an additional female collected by E. C. Van Dyke, and one male 
                      collected by R. M. Bohart for a total of 15 occurrences. Only two locations were given; the female 
                      collected by E. C. Van Dyke was at Millbrae, California, and the male collected by R. M. Bohart was 
                      at Bolinas, California (Laberge, 1961). In 2024, a study about restoring pollinator habitat in Oregon 
                      overhauled the aforementioned range by showing sightings of M. ablusus outside of California 
                      (DeBano et al., 2024). Based on the study, M. ablusus was found in Zumwalt, Oregon (Fig. 1). In 2025 a survey of bees in Utah 
                      showed a presence of M. ablusus (Fig. 1) as well (Wilson et al., 2025). No further location has been given 
                      for Utah. There are currently 3 documented occurrences of M. ablusus with a date associated. With that 
                      information, a vague approximation of annual activity can be illustrated (Fig. 2). As of now, there are no 
                      current flower records for M. ablusus, but given its relation to M. metenuus, it is somewhat reasonable to 
                      assume that M. ablusus may be a generalist.

                      M. ablusus was originally described in 1926 by Cockerell as a race of M. metenuus from Oregon. When first described as a race, M. 
                      ablusus was given no subgenus. In 1961 Laberge introduced the subgenus Callimelissodes which he notes was previously attributed to 
                      Eumelissodes, and included both M. metenuus, and M. ablusus in this subgenus. M. ablusus got re-assigned from race to species in 1961 
                      because of the opaque, dulled, rough textured surface of the galeae in contrast to the shiny, relatively non-shagreened surface of 
                      M. metenuus. Another distinction made was in the maxillary palpi in which M. ablusus females have a segment ratio of 6:5:5:1 whereas  
                      M. metenuus females have a segment ratio of 2.3:2.3:2.0:1.0, and occasionally a fifth minute segment (Laberge, 1961).

                      North American species of Melissodes (Laberge, 1961). Like all Melissodes, male M. ablusus have long 
                      antennae, and the females have short antennae in comparison (see “Genus Melissodes” page for more information). 
                      This species resides in, and is the type species of, the subgenus M. (Eumelissodes) Laberge. Both sexes of 
                      M. agilis can resemble other species in M. (Eumelissodes) Laberge, although the females can be somewhat easily 
                      distinguished by their red thoracic hairs, red to reddish brown wing veins, dulled galea, and ochraceous 
                      scopal hairs. Males can be distinguished from that of other M. (Eumelissodes) Laberge by their dulled galea, 
                      yellow maculate on mandibles and labrum, entirely yellow clypeaus, short first flagellar segment, pale ochraceous 
                      to red thoracic hairs, and hyaline tergal margins (see “Description and Identification” for more information on 
                      both sexes) (Laberge, 1961). M. agilis is seemingly an oligolege of the tribes Astereae and Heliantheae 
                      (Robertson, 1926), however, recent studies have shown that M. agilis was also a prolific pollinator of soybeans 
                      (Wheelock, 2014).</p>

                        Melissodes agilis are medium sized setacouse bees. Females range from 10 to 13 millimeters in length and 3.5 to 
                        4.5 millimeters in width. Males are a bit smaller, only being about 9 to 12 millimeters in length and 3 to 4 
                        millimeters in width. The female's first flagellar segment is on average 1.81 times the size of the second flagellar 
                        segment (standard deviation 0.027). The males are the opposite where the second flagellar segment is on average 
                        7.37 times the size of the first flagellar segment (standard deviation 0.164). Female wing length is 3.46 millimeters 
                        on average (standard deviation 0.159 millimeters), and male wing length is 3.20 millimeters on average 
                        (standard deviation 0.217 millimeters). Females have an average of 13.45 hamuli (standard deviation 0.223), 
                        while males have an average of 11.65 (standard deviation 0.274) (Laberge, 1961).

                      The integument is black, differing at the eyes which are a gray to bluish gray and rarely greenish or black with violet 
                      reflection; the wing membranes which are completely hyaline; the wing veins which are red to reddish brown; the apical half 
                      of the mandibles which are rufescent; the underside of flagellar segments 3-10 and often the apex of the second which are 
                      rufescent; the distitarsi which is also rufescent; the pterostigma which is yellow to red, and the tibial spurs that can 
                      appear yellow to a red. The clypeus has small regular punctures that are often round and separated by one to half the diameter 
                      of a puncture. The surface of the clypeus is dulled by coarse and regular reticular shagreening and often has a short median 
                      horizontal carina in the apical half. The clypeus slightly protrudes beyond the eyes in profile view, but by no more than half 
                      an eye’s width. The supraclypeal area is similar to that of the clypeus, but it’s often impunctate medially. The galeae is 
                      dulled above by dense and fine tessellation. The four maxillary palpal segments decrease in length from basal to apical in a 
                      ratio of about 4.5:3.5:3.3:1.0. The flattened lateral areas of the vertex have small round punctures that are separated on 
                      average by one to three diameters of a puncture. The surface of the vertex is dulled by irregular reticular shagreening. The 
                      mesoscutum is shiny and sparsely or not at all shagreened and has deep round punctures that are separated by one to half the 
                      diameter of a puncture. The large posteromedian area of the mesoscutum has punctures that tend to be slightly larger and more 
                      sparse. Punctures of the scutellum are similar to the punctures on the mesoscutum, but they are slightly more crowded. The 
                      metanotum is dulled by very fine reticular shagreening, and has punctures that are half the diameter of the punctures on the 
                      scutellum. The punctures are mostly separated by one to half the diameter of a puncture. The propodeum’s dorsal surface is 
                      reticulorugose and is especially coarse basally, and the posterior surface has coarse punctures except for the upper triangle. 
                      The lateral surfaces of the propodeum are similar to the posterior surface but the punctures are more crowded and the surfaces 
                      are dulled by dense regular tessellation. The mesepisternum’s lateral surface has punctures that are large, shallow, and 
                      separated mostly by half a puncture diameter or less. The surface is shiny and unshagreened or if so then finely 
                      (Laberge, 1961).

                      The first metasomal tergum’s basal three-fifths is dulled by fine tessellation and is slightly less punctate. The punctures 
                      are round, shallow, and separated mostly by one to two puncture diameters; punctures can extend to the apex at extreme sides. 
                      The apical area of the first tergum is impunctate with a shiny surface that is extremely finely reticulotransversely 
                      shagreened. The second tergum’s basal zone is shiny but has fine reticular shagreening and tiny round punctures that are 
                      separated by one to half a puncture diameter. The interband zone of the second tergum is dulled by reticulotransverse 
                      shagreening and has small irregular punctures that are separated by one to three puncture diameters; these punctures are 
                      sparser medially than in the lateral raised areas. The apical area of the second tergum has a moderately shiny surface 
                      that is dulled with fine reticulotransverse shagreening and is impunctate or if punctate then it has minute punctures that 
                      are no wider than the base of the hairs that arise from them. Each of these punctures are separated by two to four puncture 
                      diameters. Both terga 3 and 4 are similar to tergum 2, but the punctures of the interband zone are relatively more distinct 
                      and abundant, the apical zone is also smaller or absent. The pygidial plate is broadly, V-shaped, with a rounded apex (Laberge, 1961).

                      M. agilis has a somewhat small range of setal variation, the most common description of which follows. Facial and genal area 
                      hairs are pale ochraceous to yellow and the vertex is yellow to bright rufescent (the vertex will sometimes have brown hairs, 
                      if so, they are never abundant). The sides of the thorax are pale ochraceous, and the top is ochraceous to bright rufescent. 
                      The first tergum has long, ochraceous to yellow or slightly rufescent hairs basally and laterally, except for the apical area 
                      which is glabrous or has very sparse, small, appressed brown to yellow hairs basally and laterally. The second tergum’s white 
                      to yellow basal pubescent band is long and the interband zone has short, appressed to subappressed, relatively simple, white 
                      to pale hairs. The distal pale band of the second tergum is yellow to white, broad laterally (very rarely reaching apical 
                      margin) to narrow medially, and usually it’s narrowly interrupted medially. The apical area of the second tergum has relatively 
                      simple, appressed to subappressed, white to yellow hairs that obscure the surface, be it not entirely. The third tergum is 
                      similar to the second but the basal tomentum is dark brown as well as the hairs on the interband zone, the distal pale band 
                      isn’t interrupted, and the apical area is shorter. The fourth tergum is similar to the third, but the pale distal pubescent 
                      band reaches the apex across the entire tergum and occasionally has a minute apicomedial area of brown hairs. Terga 5 and 6 
                      are dark brown except for white to yellow tufts of hair at extreme sides. The sterna is pale reddish brown at extreme sides, 
                      and darker reddish brown medially. The legs are pale white to yellow except for the fore tarsi and often middle basitarsi on 
                      their outer surfaces, which is brown; the fore and middle tibiae on the outer surfaces near the apices, which are brown; The 
                      apices of the outer surfaces of the hind basitarsi and often the areas on and surrounding the basitibial plates, which are brown; 
                      the inner surfaces of the hind basitarsi, which are red to reddish brown; and the scopal hairs, which are ochraceous to yellow 
                      (Laberge, 1961).

                      The integument is black, differing at the eyes which are green to grey or greyish blue; the wing membranes, 
                      which are completely hyaline; the wing veins, which are yellow; the base of the mandibles, which are yellow 
                      to cream colored; the labrum, which is white or cream-colored and the apical margin of the labrum, which is 
                      brown, very rarely all brown; the flagellum, which is red to yellow below and dark red to brown above; the 
                      distitarsi, which is rufescent; the tegulae, which is usually testaceous and sometimes piceous; the apical 
                      margins of the terga, which are hyaline and colorless to yellow, although in some eastern individuals, it 
                      can be a translucent brown; and the tibial spurs that can appear yellow to white. The clypeus protrudes beyond 
                      the eye by about half the width of an eye in profile view. The first flagellar segment is about one-sixth to 
                      one-seventh the maximum length of the second segment (as stated above), and the penultimate segment is about 
                      three times as long (maximum) as it is wide (minimum). All flagellar segments do not have longitudinal lateral 
                      depressions. The four maxillary palpal segments decrease in length from basal to apical in a ratio of about 
                      4:3:3:1. The remainder of the characteristics are the same as the female described above except as follows: 
                      the clypeus’ short surface is often moderately shiny; the mesepisternum’s surface is usually somewhat dulled 
                      by fine and irregular shagreening; the medial portion of the first tergum’s basal four-fifths to five-sixths 
                      has small punctures that are separated by one to three puncture diameters; the interband zone of terga 2 and 
                      3’s surface is moderately shiny with reticular shagreening, and has slightly larger and more abundant 
                      punctures; the hyaline apical areas of terga 1 through 5 are shiny to moderately shiny with extremely fine 
                      reticulotransverse shagreening; the sterna’s surfaces are shiny to moderately shiny and usually have distinct 
                      regular reticular shagreening (Laberge, 1961).

                      The 7th sternum’s median plate is flat and lies in the normal ventral plane, not rotated sideways. 
                      The apicolateral angles of sternum 7 are rounded, the sternum briefly narrows into a short, broad neck, 
                      and has abundant short hairs ventrally. The membranous area between the inner edge of the lateral plate 
                      and the lower part of the median plate is almost completely obscured and appears as a thin line. The 
                      8th sternum usually has one or two hairs apicomedially, and no apical hairs medially. The apicoventral 
                      tubercle of sternum 8 is unidentate, rounded apically, and slightly surpasses the apical margin medially. 
                      The gonostylus is less than two-thirds the length of the gonocoxite and is capitate. The ventral area 
                      of the gonostylus has short sparse hairs near the base, and no hairs laterally. The spatha is sinuate 
                      apically and about three times as wide as it is long. The penis valve’s dorsolateral lamella ends at 
                      the spatha and isn’t turned inward to form a tooth just in front of the spatha (Laberge, 1961).

                      While it’s likely there are wide variations of setal color in male M. ablusus, only one specimen has currently 
                      been described. The head and thorax are pale ochraceous; the dorsum of the thorax is yellowish; the scutellum has 
                      sparse brown hairs medially. The first tergum has long pale ochraceous hairs on the basal four-fifths. The 
                      second tergum has white to pale ochraceous hairs. The basal and distal pubescent bands are white, although the 
                      distal pubescent band is often narrowly interrupted medially. The interband zone has ochraceous suberect hairs, 
                      and the apical areas are glabrous. Tergum 3 is similar to the second terga, but the basal tomentum is brown, the 
                      distal pubescent band is not interrupted medially. Terga 4 and 5 are similar to tergum 3, but have simple, suberect 
                      apical hairs that are often brown at least medially. The fourth and fifth terga’s distal pale pubescent bands are 
                      not narrowly interrupted and reach the apical margin except medially. Terga 6 and 7 have dark brown hairs. The 
                      sternal hairs are pale ochraceous and usually darkened medially. The leg hairs are white to pale ochraceous, however, 
                      the inner surfaces of basitarsi and usually the distitarsi are often pale rufescent to yellow (Laberge, 1961).

                      M. ablusus have very few documented occurrences in general, let alone from the wild. From the publicly 
                      available records, and postulates of the subgenus M. (Callimelissodes), there can be an assumed range. 
                      M. (Callimelissodes) as a subgenus mostly resides in the western United States (four species reside east 
                      of the Mississippi). In 1961, Laberge showed that M. ablusus was more widespread across the mid-south 
                      of California, which matches up with the location of the subgenus. Laberge (1961) stated that he examined 
                      3 female paratypes that were collected with the holotype (however Cockerell (1926) mentions 7 female 
                      paratypes collected with the holotype; those will be counted instead of the 3 Laberge mentioned), 6 
                      females collected with the holotype, an additional female collected by E. C. Van Dyke, and one male 
                      collected by R. M. Bohart for a total of 15 occurrences. Only two locations were given; the female 
                      collected by E. C. Van Dyke was at Millbrae, California, and the male collected by R. M. Bohart was 
                      at Bolinas, California (Laberge, 1961). In 2024, a study about restoring pollinator habitat in Oregon 
                      overhauled the aforementioned range by showing sightings of M. ablusus outside of California 
                      (DeBano et al., 2024). Based on the study, M. ablusus was found in Zumwalt, Oregon (Fig. 1). In 2025 a survey of bees in Utah 
                      showed a presence of M. ablusus (Fig. 1) as well (Wilson et al., 2025). No further location has been given 
                      for Utah. There are currently 3 documented occurrences of M. ablusus with a date associated. With that 
                      information, a vague approximation of annual activity can be illustrated (Fig. 2). As of now, there are no 
                      current flower records for M. ablusus, but given its relation to M. metenuus, it is somewhat reasonable to 
                      assume that M. ablusus may be a generalist.

                      M. ablusus was originally described in 1926 by Cockerell as a race of M. metenuus from Oregon. When first described as a race, M. 
                      ablusus was given no subgenus. In 1961 Laberge introduced the subgenus Callimelissodes which he notes was previously attributed to 
                      Eumelissodes, and included both M. metenuus, and M. ablusus in this subgenus. M. ablusus got re-assigned from race to species in 1961 
                      because of the opaque, dulled, rough textured surface of the galeae in contrast to the shiny, relatively non-shagreened surface of 
                      M. metenuus. Another distinction made was in the maxillary palpi in which M. ablusus females have a segment ratio of 6:5:5:1 whereas  
                      M. metenuus females have a segment ratio of 2.3:2.3:2.0:1.0, and occasionally a fifth minute segment (Laberge, 1961).
