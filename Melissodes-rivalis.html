                    <p>Melissodes rivalis, the rival long-horned bee, is a species of long-horned bee in the family Apidae. It is most commonly found in northern parts of the United States, as well as Canada. [1][2][3][4] This species is native to Montana, although it has also been spotted in other northern states including Idaho, Wyoming, and Minnesota.[5] As a part of the Eucerini tribe, this species' male has unusually long antennae, as well as being a solitary bee, therefore, it does not create colonies or store honey, though some may form large aggregations.[6][7] Unlike colonial bees, the female Melissodes rivalis constructs and provisions her own fossorial nest without outside help, while males tend to sleep in flower heads.[7][8]</p>
